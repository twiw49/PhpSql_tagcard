(11, 'Flu, also known as influenza, is a viral infection of the nose, sinuses, throat, and respiratory tract.  It’s seasonal, often occurring in winter, and can spread rapidly, called then flu epidemic.', 'Flu (often referred as influenza), is a viral infection of the nose, sinuses, throat, and respiratory tract by an influenza or parainfluenza virus.  Swine flu and bird (avian) flu are specific strains of flu.', 'When the infection occurs in healthy young people, it is usually not dangerous and lasts around one or two weeks.  In some cases a dry cough may develop and last a bit longer.  Elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses have a higher risk for complications.  For this reason it’s recommended that these groups get vaccinated.  Swine and bird flus are caused by slight different influenza viruses, but causing similar symptoms.  Flu typically develops rapidly, with fever (sometimes accompanied with chills), muscle pain, headache, a dry and painful cough,  sore throat, and exhaustion or fatigue.  It’s important to note that the flu is different from the common cold, which is often also caused by a virus, but causes milder symptoms.', 'Even today flu can have fatal consequences for those with pre-existing conditions and requires a hospital stay with emergency medical measures.  Normally it is self-limited and the body recovers by itself.  A doctor may prescribe medication to help shorten the course of the flu if taken early.  Bed rest and staying hydrated are usually sufficient.  Medications such as Ibuprofen or Aspirin can lower a fever and relieve symptoms, but they will not shorten the course of the illness and should be used in children with caution.  Flu vaccine is recommended for the following groups at risk:  nursing infants, people over 60, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women.'),
(12, 'Atrial fibrillation is a temporary or lasting arrhythmia of the heart in which the heart’s chambers don’t fill enough and this leads to typical complaints.', 'Atrial fibrillation is a trouble of the heart’s normal rhythm. Patients may experience heart palpitations and shortness of breath or even temporarily loss of consciousness.', 'Atrial fibrillation may intermittently occur in healthy people and more often in patients with a known cardiac disorder. Atrial fibrillation often goes unnoticed in those with it. Still, palpitations, a racing heart, feelings of dizziness, shortness of breath, and even momentary unconsciousness may occur.', 'Occasionally a blood clot may form in the atrium, and leave the atria leading to a stroke (cerebrovascular accident). Therefore patients are treated with blood-thinning drugs (mostly Marcoumar or Sintrom). The further treatment aims to keep the heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute, so that the heart can pump effectively. This may be attempted with medication, a pacemaker or a so-called cardioversion.'),
(14, 'Asthma is a common, persistent, and inflammatory disease of the lungs and its comorbidities can affect the whole respiratory tract. It can occur as difficulty in breathing or a decline in performance at school, work, or in sport. The respiratory tract of an asthma patient possesses abnormal characteristics, it drastically constricts and swells with inflammation as an excessive response to external agents (e.g. physical effort or allergies), as a result, the affected person do not receive enough air in the lungs.', 'Asthma is a disease of the lungs which constricts the respiratory tract and causes shortness of breath. The majority of asthma attacks are caused by allergies. Left untreated, asthma can lead to chronic lung damage.', 'Asthma can be caused by allergies or be independent from allergies. Those with asthma caused by allergies often have family members with allergies against pollen. During an asthma attack, patients suffer from intense shortness of breath with noticeably loud breathing and coughing. Heart palpitations may also occur.', 'In children with asthma there is a high chance that the disease diminishes over the years, but in adults this is not often the case. Left untreated, asthma can lead to lasting damage in the lungs and permanent shortness of breath. Treatment of asthma caused by allergies is a matter of treating the underlying allergy. Furthermore, asthma patients generally receive medication that opens up the respiratory tract and, if necessary, medication that reduces the inflammation in the respiratory tract.'),
(15, 'Allergies occur when the body’s defense system, known as the immune system, triggers an undesirable, inflammatory reaction to a substance (e.g. harmless materials in the environment, known as allergens), which would generally cause no reaction when in contact with people without allergies.', 'An allergy is an undesired reaction to a substance which under normal circumstances do not cause any reaction in healthy people.  Many substances can cause an allergy, e.g. pollen from trees and grasses, animal hair, dust mites, food, medications, and certain skin products.', 'Allergies against pollen from trees and grasses are commonly known as hay fever.  It can manifest in the form of inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), hay fever (rhinitis), and/or asthma and usually occurs in spring and summer.\n      Dust mites and animal hair can also trigger allergies, which can also be identified through inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), chronic nasal discomfort (rhinitis), and/or asthma.  These often manifest themselves throughout the year.\n      Certain foods can also trigger allergic reactions, which can lead to either very mild symptoms (for example, a prickling sensation in the mouth and throat areas after enjoying certain fruits) or to life threatening reactions throughout the body.  These need to be\n      distinguished from intolerance reactions.\n      Medications are yet another group of substances which can trigger allergies, usually involving the skin, but which can also affect internal or', 'In rare cases, an allergic reaction can become life threatening.  In such a case, the patient must have an emergency kit at their disposal that he can use himself (see the article on food allergies).  The treatment of allergies consists, when possible, of the avoidance of the substance that causes them. When the substance cannot be avoided, medical alleviation of the ailments becomes necessary, for example, with antihistamines.  In certain cases a specific kind of immunotherapy, also called desensitization, is indicated.'),
(16, 'High blood pressure, also known as arterial hypertension, is the state of  constant high pressure in the blood vessels, specifically the arteries. According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, a blood pressure that is less than 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) is normal. This means that a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg (a millimeter of mercury, the unit of measurement for pressure) or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg is considered high and should be treated. The systolic pressure corresponds to the maximum pressure in the larger arteries and is generated during contraction and ejection stages of the cardiac cycle (called the atrial systole). Diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure in the arteries and happens during the relaxation and filling stages of the cardiac cycle (known as atrial diastole), and is a measurement for the constant load on the vessel walls.', 'High blood pressure is a chronic increase in the pressure in certain blood vessels, which can be dangerous, as it can lead to permanent damage of vital organs such as the brain, heart or eyes.', 'High blood pressure is common and usually goes unnoticed by the affected individual. For this reason, periodically having your blood pressure taken at a check-up by an expert (such as a doctor or nurse) is highly recommended. Uncomfortable symptoms such as early morning headaches, palpitations, dizziness, and ringing in the ears occur seldom.', 'Untreated high blood pressure can lead to permanent damage of blood vessels in vital organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys, and eyes. High blood pressure can be lowered with a change in lifestyle (low sodium diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, regular exercise) and in most cases associated with medication.'),
(17, 'Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which the body’s release of the hormone insulin is either reduced or the effectiveness of the hormone is reduced. The pancreas is responsible for the constant production of insulin.', 'Diabetes is a disease in which the level of blood sugar remains high, which can lead to damage of the smaller blood vessels, which in turn can damage various organs such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart.', 'Diabetes due to a reduced release of or total lack of insulin is referred to as Type-1 diabetes (formerly juvenile diabetes mellitus) and is actually an autoimmune disease. Here, the body’s defense system turns against the body itself. The resulting reduced efficiency of the insulin is referred to as Type-2 diabetes (formerly called adult onset diabetes).', 'It’s important to note that blood sugar levels that remain high lead to damage in small blood vessels in various organs including the eyes, kidneys, heart, and nerves that contribute to tactile sensation. This damage of the vessels leads to damage in these organs. Injury to nerves in the hands and feet is often referred to as polyneuropathy. The treatment of diabetes is carried out through regularly checking blood sugar levels and through medication. When it comes to medication, either insulin shots are administered or in the case of Type-2 diabetes it may be enough to take medications that strengthen the effect of insulin or insulin production. Regular and consistent testing of your average blood sugar levels over a period of 3 months with an HbA1c test by your doctor is important, as well as regular eye examinations by your ophthalmologist.'),
(18, 'Reflux disease is very common worldwide.  It is usually due to a backflow of stomach acid through a weakened esophagus.  If this occurs regularly, it will develop into gastroesophageal reflux disease, a burning of the mucous membrane in the esophagus.', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease is often referred to as gastric or acid reflux disease, as this is the most common complaint.  The cause of this symptom is a backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, which then causes a burning sensation (hence the name).', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs in about 20% of the population in industrial countries.  The main symptom is a dull burning, or feelings of pain or pressure in the throat and chest areas, which is where it gets the common name heartburn.  It frequently occurs when lying down (at night for example), after copious eating, or after consumption of alcohol and can become noticeable as a chronic cough.', 'In certain cases, damage to the mucous membrane in the throat can become permanent (Barrett’s esophagus) which requires regular check-ups with a specialist, since this damage can degenerate.  For people suffering from this, it’s recommended that they maintain a low-fat diet, avoid eating meals late at night, quit smoking and using alcohol, and in the case of overweight patients a reduction in weight it recommended.  Medications that reduce stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors, for example) have been shown to be effective, but they do not treat the cause of the reflux of acid.  Furthermore, a test to discover if a stomach infection of Helicobacter pylori is at play may be appropriate, since this can cause or intensify heartburn.  In most cases this can be cured with a treatment of antibiotics.'),
(19, 'It’s been shown that the smoking of tobacco products damages organs, especially the lungs; the mucous membranes in the mouth, throat, and nose, blood circulation, the heart and the brain.', 'Smoking damages many organs of the body, including the lungs, heart, and brain.  Smokers can consequently suffer from lung cancer, heart attacks, or strokes.  Smokers die on average 13-14 years earlier than non-smokers.', 'As a consequence of using tobacco products, smokers have a higher chance of developing cancer (usually lung cancer), of having a (fatal) heart attack, suffering from a stroke, and developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Because lung cancer (see: lung carcinoma) often does not cause any complaints until late, it is often discovered at a stage, where the disease can no longer be cured.  Damage to the organs is caused by various highly poisonous substances that are found in tobacco smoke.  Smoking not only does the smoker harm, but also people in their surroundings due to passive smoking.  It should be noted that even tobacco smoke that is passively inhaled contains poisonous substances that are even more concentrated than smoke that passes through a filter.  It is extremely dangerous for nursing babies and small children.', 'The only logical “treatment” is to quit.  It has been shown that even as soon as a few months after quitting, symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stop.  The risks of lung cancer, heart attack, and stroke are halved or even normalized after 5-10 years of quitting.'),
(20, 'Irritable bowel syndrome is known also as spastic colon. This condition is characterized by an increase in impulsive motility or contractions of muscles located in the large and small intestines. Such contraction or motility is known as spasm and connected to irritable bowel syndrome. However, the condition can also be connected to a decrease in motility. This makes the name spastic colon less accurate. The severity and cause of the condition is not always the same among patients. The objective of the treatment will be to alleviate symptoms by improving lifestyle and taking certain medications.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome describes a non dangerous disease of the intestines that is experienced as pain and unpleasant feelings around the stomach, as well as changes in stools. Up to 50% of patients with stomach and intestinal complaints have irritable bowel syndrome.', 'Irritable bowel syndrome is very common and affects women twice as much as men. Complaints vary widely and usually accompany irregular bowel movements and last for a long time. In order to rule out other intestinal illnesses, patients with irritable bowel syndrome are often examined over a long period of time. After ruling out other illnesses, a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is given.', 'The disease is very common, lasts a long time, and causes uncomfortable symptoms, but is not dangerous. An effective therapy is not known. Treatment depends on symptoms and consists of administering medications that support or slow down intestinal voiding and bowel movements. Changes in eating habits may help in individual cases (foods rich in fiber, for example).'),
(26, 'Psoriasis is a disorder that usually affects the skin and nails, but can also affect the joints. Psoriasis produces scaly, whitish, thick plaques that may be large or small on the knees, elbows, and scalp. Joints may be affected with a form of arthritis.', 'Psoriasis is a disease that affects the skin, nails, and joints. It creates scaly, thickened skin usually on the knees, elbows, and scalp.', 'The cause behind psoriasis has not yet been explained, but it seems that genetic and environmental factors activate the immune system of the skin in such a way, that a localized heightened immune response occurs as well as an inflamed thickening of the top layers of skin. The disease is usually worse in youth than in adulthood. Patients often complain of itching and in certain cases it can manifest as a general feeling of illness or fever. Additionally, the highly visible lesions can become a mental burden for many patients.', 'Treatment consists of decreasing inflammation of affected areas with anti-inflammatory drugs (cortisone, for example) and normalizing excessive thickening and hornification of the skin. Light therapy often contributes to the reduction of complaints. Many patients feel that their symptoms improve while vacationing in sunny locations.'),
(27, 'Acne is a disease that affects the sebaceous glands. In a nutshell, too much sebum (skin fat) is produced, the sebum producing glands become congested, and they may become infected by a bacteria, the Propionibacterium acnes.', 'Acne is a skin disease that affects the sebaceous glands and is often made visible by abnormalities in the skin such as blackheads and pustules.', 'Acne can be identified by the presence of various skin changes, such as comedones (also called blackheads), skin nodules (also called papula), pustules, and lumps. Acne often occurs during puberty due to hormonal influences and is more frequent with boys. Moreover it is associated with a higher familial incidence. Despite popular beliefs, acne is not a problem of bad hygiene.', 'Certain forms of acne can leave unsightly scars behind, which may impact the patient. Early treatment can prevent or partly alleviate this issue. Treatment aims to clear the ducts of sebaceous glands, reduce the production of sebum, and to relieve inflammation from abnormalities in the skin by fighting certain bacteria of the skin. Treatment usually takes a long time and in extreme cases should be implemented by a skin doctor (dermatologist).'),
(29, 'Suspicious skin lesions are most commonly mentioned in relation to a suspected skin cancer. Especially the A-B-C-D-E rule for the screening of moles and birthmarks helps to separate harmless birthmarks from suspicious ones. A stands for Asymmetry, lesions that are asymmetric are suspicious. B stands for Border, suspicious are lesions with uneven borders. It is said that these are lesions that can’t be clearly circled with a pen. C stands for colour, meaning the colouring of the birthmark. Suspicious here are birthmarks with a variety of colours. D stands for Diameter, suspicious are moles with a diameter larger than 6mm.

Changes to the skin, especially suspicious ones should be examined by a doctor – ideally by a dermatologist.', 'A suspicious change of the skin might be caused by an infection in or on the skin such as a wart. The virus of a wart is transmitted through skin contact. Shingles or chickenpox that happens throughout the body can also trigger suspicious changes of skin. Birthmarks are changes of skin that are usually present since birth. Some suspicious changes can follow a sensitivity or an allergic response triggered by conditions such as diabetes or poor circulation. Autoimmune illnesses like psoriasis can also trigger changes on the skin. Most cancers are detected through obvious signs such as sickness, pain, tenderness, bumps or lumps. However, it is difficult to identify a change of skin since the change is not often obvious. The detection of a suspicious change of skin is tricky because usually this change happens gradually and without clear signs. However, it is recommended to use always a thumb to feel for any change while making the difference between normal and unusual detail. A person sho', 'Suspicious skin lesions can occur at any age. If an affected person observes a lesion that matches the criteria mentioned above, or worries for other reasons, he should consult a doctor, ideally a dermatologist. If the doctor finds the skin lesion suspicious as well, it will usually be removed surgically. A pathologist will evaluate the removed tissue under a microscope. If the suspicion is confirmed, the doctor will discuss the next steps with the affected person. Depending on the pathologist’s findings, the previous surgery may have been sufficient, but sometimes a larger area around the lesion might be needed to be removed, or further therapy (chemo-, radiotherapy) may be necessary.'),

People of all age groups can be affected, including  young children and babies, however the condition is most common in old people after they have reached 70.', 'Glaucoma is a disease of the eye. Glaucoma is caused by damage to the optic nerve, usually from high intraocular pressure, which can lead to partial or complete blindness.', 'The most common cause of glaucoma is high intraocular pressure, which can lead to damage of the optic nerve. Additionally, people with relatives with glaucoma, diabetes, heavily fluctuating blood pressure, and old age have a higher risk of developing glaucoma. The majority of glaucoma causes develop over a period of time, and patients seldom perceive a reduction of their field of vision. Additionally, glaucoma can as well manifest by strong eye pain, nausea and vomiting, interruption of vision, as well as a reddening of the affected eye and may require emergency treatment.', 'If glaucoma is left untreated it will slowly lead to blindness in the affected eye. Therefore it’s essential to get your eyes checked regularly by a specialist (ophthalmologist) if you experience increased intraocular pressure. Most cases can be medicated. In rare cases or cases where medication fails to treat the issue, intervention by operation can help reduce intraocular pressure.'),

In contrast to the eye lens of a healthy person which is clear the person affected suffers from a misty or cloudy lens, which has become less clear over time that impacts the vision. Cataracts begin to develop sometimes with persons who are getting older and impacts their lens in a way that the light is being stopped to reach the back part of the eye, in specific the retina. This is where the \"seeing\" is happening, meaning that the optical images are converted into signals which then can be transmitted to our visual part of the brain. Cataracts become worse over the time and begin to affect vision. Surgery will be needed eventually to remove and replaced the damaged lens.', 'Gray cataract, also just simply called cataract, is a disease of the eye that leads to a slow clouding of the eye lens. Patients often complain of sensitivity to glare, a reduction in sharpness of vision, or cloudy vision.', 'The disease usually occurs in advanced age and gradually progresses. The clouding of the lens first leads to disruptive sensitivity to light, especially to glare from backlighting at night time, and later leads to impaired sight. Many patients with cataract report cloudy or obscured vision.', 'If the clouded lense is not removed, blindness in the affected eye may occur. Treatment consists of a short operation by an ophthalmologist wherein the affected abnormal lense is replaced by an artificial lense. The operation is relatively low-risk and in the most optimal cases allows the patient an immediate improvement in their vision.'),

It leads to complaints such as redness, burning, and a feeling that there is a foreign object in the eye.', 'The disease leads to issues such as redness, burning, and feeling like there is a foreign object in the eye. Increased evaporation causes a poor formation of the tear film coating the eye and leads to a loss in moisture.

It means hearing sounds that are originating not from outside but from inside the body. The condition is described often by a ringing sound even if the patient can hear several sounds including whistling, hissing, humming, grinding, and buzzing. Some patients can have pulsatile tinnitus when the noises they hear beat in rhythm with their pulse. Other people can hear noises similar to singing or music.', 'Tinnitus is very common. It can emerge as a result of loud noise (music, artillery fire), certain medications, hearing loss in the elderly, problems with the jaw’s temporomandibular joint, or because of overwhelming stress. Those with tinnitus perceive a disturbing, whistling or humming noise in their ears. In many cases, troubles to sleep, weakness of concentration, and partial impairment of hearing may also occur and compromise quality of life.', 'Tinnitus is rarely caused by a tumor of the acoustic nerve or vascular problems, which can be resolved by operation. For this reason it’s recommended that you see a specialist for clarification. In the case of a short-term occurrence it’s recommended that you keep calm and wait until the next morning. If it is still present in the morning, make an appointment with your doctor, and if necessary, seek treatment. Quiet and relaxation are generally beneficial. Medication is an option.  Cortisone and substances that promote blood circulation can achieve an alleviation of complaints. Treatment could be difficult and may not cure tinnitus.'),

Anyone can experience otitis media but the condition is most common in children between six and fifteen months old. According to some studies, 1 in each 4 children are affected by the condition before their tenth year of life. Otitis media accompanies often various respiratory infections including flu and common cold. This is due to the connection of the middle ear with the upper respiratory tract through a small channel called the Eustachian tube. This tube is so thin that microbes that are existing in the sinus cavities or nose penetrate into the middle ear over the Eustachian tube and begin growing. There are numerous subtypes of Otitis Media. These types include adhesive otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and acute otitis media.', 'Otitis media, is an inflammation of the middle ear, which is located between the external auditory canal with the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and the inner ear. The inflammation causes swelling and redness followed by a gathering of liquid behind the eardrum.', 'Pathogens (viruses and bacteria) may induce inflammation of the middle ear, which is especially common in children.  The inflammation is typically experienced as an (pulsating) earache and fever and usually heals on its own within a week.  This type of inflammation is different from long term (chronic) middle ear infections that affect either the mucus membranes or the bones of the middle ear (a disease called cholesteatoma) which generally leads to lasting damage of the eardrum.', 'While chronic middle ear inflammation of the mucus membrane is not life-threatening, chloesteatoma can attack the structures in the middle and inner ear. This form of inflammation requires surgery. For the treatment of acute forms, anti-inflammatory nasal sprays and pain medication are often effective against symptoms. Treatment with antibiotics, in the base of a bacterial infection, is effective and shorts the length of the disease.'),

Sometimes, irritation or allergy can be the cause.', 'It is predominantly adults who are affected, especially those with injuries to the ear canal, or who have not cleaned the ear properly, or who suffer from diabetes or immuno-deficiencies. This kind of infection is noticeable due to intense earaches and the urge to itch inside the ear.

Pulling on the earlobes and pressing on the outer ear are painful.', 'Diabetics are frequently affected by aggressive bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which requires treatment with antibiotics over the course of several weeks. Treatment depends on the cause, which is not always known. Minor infections can be treated with vinegar water (one part vinegar, one part water) dripped into the ear. More serious cases can be treated with eardrops with antibiotics. An allergic inflammation of the outer ear canal can be treated with anti-inflammatory ear drops (such as cortisone).'),

It is mainly used when the ear canal is blocked with earwax, which can cause sudden hearing problems and ringing in the ears.', 'A sudden hearing impairment of one ear is the main symptom for cerumen obturans. The hearing impairment often occurs after the ear canal has been in contact with water, because dried earwax soaks with water, expands and therefore closes the ear canal completely. Another common symptom is ringing in the ears (tinnitus). This can also be caused by earwax closing the outer ear canal.', 'Descriptions of the symptoms lead the doctor to an assumption that will be verified by an endoscopy of the ear canal. The earwax will then be removed from the ear canal. There are various ways to remove it, such as suction, rinsing with warm water or usage of hydrogen peroxide. To prevent the build-up of earwax into an impaction it’s suggested to avoid cleaning the ears with cotton swabs, but to rinse it regularly. This is preferred to be done by a doctor, because the eardrum and middle ear may become damaged if removal is not professionally executed.'),

Swallowed blood can cause nausea and diarrhoea.', 'It’s recommended that patients sit down, bowing their head forward, so that the blood can flow out of the nose and not into stomach or lungs. Cooling the neck and pressing the nostrils together can stop bleedings from the front part of the nose; however, it won’t work for bleedings from the back of the nose. If the bleeding doesn’t stop, or if other symptoms such as dizziness or fainting occur, a doctor should be consulted immediately. Even if the patient has an existing blood clotting disorder or takes blood-thinning medication, a visit to the doctor could be necessary to treat the source of bleeding adequately.

The infection is usually caused by intestinal bacteria. Common symptoms include desire to urinate, burning, and frequent urination.', 'Women are more likely to get a urinary tract infection than men, since the urethra (thus the distance that bacteria have to travel) is shorter in women.  Common causes include sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and exposure to cool and wet conditions.  Additionally, abnormal draining of the urinary tract may also play a role.  The affected person may experience pain, burning, and itching during urination as well as an urge to urinate frequently.  However, should the urinary tract infection spread to include the kidneys (known as pyelonephritis), it then becomes a serious illness.  Accompanying the above symptoms are fever and side pains.', 'An infection of the urinary tract (also called a UTI or cystitis) is usually harmless and requires no treatment in women without symptoms.  Women and men affected by symptoms usually require treatment with antibiotics.  An infection of the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis) can spread to the bloodstream and thus requires treatment with antibiotics.'),

The most common fractures are the vertebrae, femur (nearest the hips), forearm (near the wrist), head of the humerus, and the pelvis.', 'Osteoporosis is characterized by loss of bone substance of the whole body, thinning or shrinking the trabeculae. This leads to the bones becoming fragile, so that they break easier or spontaneously. Frequent fractures of e.g. vertebral bodies, thigh- or forearm bones can occur.', 'Osteoporosis mainly affects elderly persons and, within this group, mainly women. Most common reason is a vitamin D deficiency; in women it is mainly hormonal changes after the menopause that causes calcium and phosphate to dissolve from the bone. The bone mass decreases, the bones are not as robust anymore and typical fractures and related pain occur. Spontaneous fractures (without any hit- or push-impact) most commonly occur in the vertebrae, but also in the pelvis or the forearm. Low bone-stability leads to frequent typical fractures that can occur either spontaneously or following slight traumata.', 'Blood tests and bone density measurements with certain x-rays can help the doctor to diagnose osteoporosis. Besides tending to existing fractures, treatment will depend on the identified causes. A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D as well as regular exercise are very important in the prevention and reduction of bone loss. Foods that are high in calcium include dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese), dried figs, almonds, sesame seeds, cod liver oil, salmon, and chicken eggs. Because vitamin D is produced predominantly after sun exposure in the skin and is not easily absorbed from digested foods, it’s recommended that people from 65 years onwards use calcium and vitamin D dietary supplements to prevent osteoporosis. If the presence of osteoporosis is confirmed in a bone density test (a densitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DXA), treatment with calcium and vitamin D should be started immediately.

Usually, hyperventilation syndrome develops in context of stress, anxiety, excitement, or panic.', 'Hyperventilation, called sometimes overbreathing, is breathing in excess of what the body needs. Sometimes, deep or rapid breathing is seen in very serious conditions such as heart attack, bleeding, or infection.', 'Women in their 20s and 30s are affected the most.  During a hyperventilation attack, the patient develops feelings of narrowness in the chest, sharp chest pain and shortness of breath despite increased breathing.  Additionally, sensory disorders can be noticed, like  “pins and needles”, reduction of sense of touch. Hands can cramp up in a so-called “obstetrician’s hand”.  Shaking, headache, dizziness, and palpitations can also occur.  In rare cases, hyperventilation syndrome has a physical cause, but it is usually caused by psychological conditions.', 'During a hyperventilation attack, the patient should be calmed down and made to breathe into a bag. After an accurate diagnostic of the condition, the doctor will arrange, if the syndrome is not really serious, follow-up care with a primary care doctor or a psychiatrist who will teach the patient about the condition and techniques to help control the attacks. Breathing exercises and psychosomatic therapy can help to identify an attack early on and to stop it with measured breathing. Sometimes, certain medicine can be prescribed after a follow-up care. With appropriate training, the patient may use stress reducing techniques, breathing exercises and certain medication to reduce the severity and number of the attacks. These attacks can be reduced also with therapy for any other anxiety issue.'),

It’s possible to get some vitamin D through dietary supplements, such as cod liver, salmon, chicken eggs, and beef liver, but the amount of vitamin that these sources provide is not sufficient.', 'Vitamin D deficiency is a regular condition. Vitamin D plays vital roles for numerous functions within the body including reducing inflammation, promoting cell and bone growth, keeping normal levels of phosphate and calcium, and promoting the absorption of calcium. For these reasons a lack of Vitamin D can commonly lead to osteomalacia in adults or rickets in children.', 'Numerous factors can lead to lack of vitamin D. A firm vegan regime for a long period can deprive the body from the sufficient amount of vitamin D since animals are the natural providers of this vitamin. A limited exposure to the light from sun can also lead to vitamin D deficiency since the body produces vitamin D when the skin is exposed to its light. A limited exposure to the light from the sun can happen when a person puts on long dresses or covers themselves for religious motives, or have activities that keep them away from the sun. People with dark skin are also at risk of vitamin D deficiency since the ability of the skin to produce Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight is reduced by the pigment melanin. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused also by the inability of the kidney to convert this vitamin to its active type. This can happen in case of disease or ageing process. This deficiency can also be caused by the inability of the digestive tract to absorb adequately vitamin D. This c', 'Because the population is chronically deficient in vitamin D, it’s recommended nowadays that all people older than 60 take vitamin D with calcium as food supplements. It has been shown that muscle power increases based on that and that the bone loss (osteoporosis) can be positively influenced as well as the frequency of falls can be reduced. As the diseases related to a deficiency of vitamin D can be critical it is important for a potentially affected person to find a suitable therapy with help of a medical doctor in order to reach the necessary level.'),

Enlargement of the prostate makes urination difficult, causes the urine to flow back along the urinary tract, and may also cause bladder or kidney infections.', 'BPH causes the urinary tract to become narrowed and this can cause urine to flow backwards. People with BPH notice that it takes longer to urinate, the stream of urine is weaker, and when urination has finished, they still feel that the bladder has not been completely emptied and drops of urine continue to drip. Additionally, an urge to urinate frequently develops and intensifies during the night. Depending on the growth of BPH, the sex life of the person with it may be negatively affected and have an influence in the patient’s quality of life.

The blood vessels of patients with increase blood lipids are prone to hardening of the vessel walls (arteriosclerosis), which can lead to heart attacks, stroke, and circulation disorders in the limbs (peripheral artery disease). Besides that, patients with high blood lipid levels may also suffer from pancreatitis. Storage of blood lipids in the liver may also occur, which can lead to fatty liver disease (steatosis of the liver) or hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). Furthermore, it can lead to fat depositions in the skin known as xanthomas.', 'If blood lipid levels can be lowered, then the risk of a heart attack and overall mortality will also be significantly reduced. Healthier levels can be achieved through medication, an improvement in dietary habit, weight loss, and regular physical exercise. Besides that, other illnesses that cause increased blood lipids should be treated properly and alcohol should be avoided.'),

In the majority of cases, the first symptom is a nodule (nodular basal-cell carcinoma), which has a pearl-like shine and is surrounded or lined by small blood vessels. This nodule grows slowly outward and deeper into the skin and bleeding can occur. Nodules can disrupt, giving an ulcer-like appearance. Other, very rare forms of basal cell carcinoma can be brownish (pigmented carcinoma), contain fluids (cystic carcinoma), or may be smooth and reddened (superficial carcinoma). Basal-cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that rarely metastasizes, but which can heavily destroy surrounding tissue with its growth and can cause serious complications. It may, for example, destroy bone tissue and damage nerves.', 'Basal-cell carcinoma can be surgically removed.  The treatment requires large areas of surrounding  tissue to be removed, to assure that all tumor is excised.

This method is not as guaranteed as surgical removal and after several years the skin may show signs of radiation damage.  If you have basal-cell carcinoma, your doctor can talk to you about which method is the best for you.  Metastasis is very rare for basal-cell carcinoma.  After the tumor excision, relapse is possible, though not frequent.

There are multiple degrees of severity of bladder cancer depending on how advanced tumor growth is, which structures in the bladder wall are affected, and even if other surrounding organs are affected. Treatment depends on the severity of the cancer.', 'Bladder cancer is when there is a growth of abnormal tissue, called tumor, that develops in the bladder lining. The most common symptom is blood in the urine which usually occurs painless. The tumor can spread, in some cases, into the surrounding muscles. Bladder cancer is a malignant cancer type. It affects older men three times more often than women.', 'Patients usually end up visiting a doctor when they notice blood in their urine (macrohematuria) without the presence of any pain. Besides blood in urine, other symptoms during urination can occur. Advanced stages may present with flank pains, which are due to the poor transportation of urine from the kidneys into the bladder. In about 20% of cases there are no symptoms accompanying bladder cancer. Routine urine analysis can find a microscopic amount of blood in the urine (microhematuria) and signs of white blood cells in the urine.', 'If the symptoms listed above appear, then an ultrasound should be done to eliminate the possibility of other diseases. Next, an endoscopy of the bladder is performed, which allows a view of the bladder’s surface. Abnormalities around the bladder can then be cleared or samples can be taken. Sometimes it’s possible to obtain cells to determine if the type of cancer. This is done with repeated flushing of the bladder via a urinary catheter. To determine whether it’s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in com'),

Venous insufficiency can have various causes. Standing for long hours, but also sitting with the knees bent impairs the reverse blood flow, so that the valves have to stand higher pressure. A family-induced weakness of the connective tissue can further cause the venous valves not to close properly. The resulting pressure increase in the veins leads to enlarged veins (sometimes visible as varicose veins) and further symptoms, which allow the condition to be separated in three stages.', 'Chronic venous insufficiency involves the failure of venal valves to close properly, so that the blood-flow, especially to the legs, is slowed down. The blood can’t properly flow “uphill”, increasing pressure inside the veins and leading to the typical symptoms.', 'In stage one, patients suffer from swelling of the ankle and lower leg that worsens throughout the day and improves upon elevating the legs. The legs feel heavy and painful. The skin around the ankles can look dark blue (Corona phlebectatica), and the veins in this area are clearly visible. In stage two, the oedema are more or less strong, reddish-brown skin alterations appear along the lower leg, the skin becomes thin and a stasis dermatitis, a strongly itching skin inflammation caused by congestion, may occur. In stage three, all symptoms mentioned before can still be observed, and additionally the patients suffer from recurring wounds and ulcers that heal very slowly, especially above the inside of the ankle. Night cramps and a tingling sensation of the legs can occur at all stages.', 'Increasing ankle oedema and heavy, painful or even open legs lead the patient to see a doctor. Vessel sonography and an x-ray of the veins with contrast agents confirm the diagnosis; identify the affected parts and help planning the therapy. Conservative treatments include support stocking of compression class II, alternatively the legs can be wrapped with short-stretch bandages or a zinc paste bandage. Long standing and sitting should be avoided for the benefit of lying and walking. Kneipp applications (hot/cold sequence showers) support the venous blood return, as well as the activation of the muscle pump, the active ankle movement, whereby the lower leg muscles work and basically “squeeze out” the veins.

An early detection improves the chances of a successful treatment.', 'Treatments of colon cancer depend on the stage of the cancer and include: 1) Surgery with complete removal of the cancer cells: Early stage (Stage 0) colon cancer may be removed by colonoscopy to eliminate the cancer cells. For stages 1, 2, and 3, a more invasive surgery known as a partial colon resection is required to remove the part of the colon that is cancerous. 2) Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells: patients with stage 3 colon cancer normally receive chemotherapy for 6-8 months after surgery. It is also used to reduce symptoms and to prolong the survival of patients with stage 4 colon cancer. 3) Radiation therapy to destroy the cancerous tissue is usually used in the presence of rectal cancers to reduce their size before surgery.

Small ganglion cysts can have the size of a pea while larger ones can be about 2.5 centimeters in diameter. Their location can interfere sometimes with joint motion and they can be painful if they press on an adjacent nerve.', 'A ganglion is a benign growth caused by a small eversion of the joint capsule or the tendons, usually of the hands. It is filled with synovial fluid (joint fluid). Ganglion cysts are lumps, which are noncancerous and develop most commonly along the joints or tendons of writs or hands.', 'The causes of ganglion cysts are not known exactly but some factors can increase the risk for ganglion cysts. While ganglion cysts can develop in anybody, they occur mostly in women starting at the age of 20 up to 40. People with osteoarthritis in the finger joints near to the nails of their fingers are most likely to develop the condition close to those joints. People who have injured their tendons or joints in the past have also a higher risk of developing ganglion cysts. A ganglion cyst is usually painless. The pain can occur when a cyst presses on a nerve but even small cysts can cause muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, or pain. Large ganglion cysts form noticeable lumps. Most people consult a doctor because of motion restriction and cosmetic issues.', 'Since ganglion cysts are often painless, there is no need for treatment. Doctors can recommend a watch-and wait-strategy. In case of pain or interference with joint motion, the doctor can recommend immobilization since activity can cause the cyst to grow larger. Immobilization of the affected area can be done with a splint or brace for a short time to make the cyst shrink and to relieve pain. Doctors can also suggest aspiration or surgery if other approaches have failed. However, the cyst can recur even after surgery.'),

It can cause very serious conditions and even lead to death, especially in adults. It appears with flu-like symptoms: fever, nausea, and aches. In rare cases, patients may develop inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can cause jaundice (icterus), as well as cause blood clotting disorders with increased proneness to bleeding, which can be fatal. The World Health Organisation recommends a vaccination when travelling to affected areas.', 'In the first stage of the disease, the symptoms are similar to flu, with sudden, very high fever (40°C), chills, headache and muscle aches, nausea and vomiting and conjunctivitis of the eye. In stage two (day 3 to 4), the fever drops and the symptoms decrease. The disease will now either heal or develop into stage three. In this stage, the fever rises again and organs will be damaged, with liver and kidney failure and bleedings inside the gastrointestinal tract or into the skin. The combination of blood loss and fever often causes a circulatory shock.', 'A treatment of the cause, which would be killing the virus, does not exist. It is only possible, to treat the patients in an intensive care unit to relieve the symptoms and to balance out the loss of liquids. Even though, the adult mortality rate lies between 20% and 50%. It is therefore highly recommended to find out about a vaccination recommendation before travelling to tropical countries. As this might be necessary for other diseases as well, and because especially the yellow fever vaccination requires certain waiting periods between other vaccinations, you should plan your vaccinations as early as possible.'),

Additional factors such as obesity, which increases pressure inside the abdomen, can cause this weakness to develop faster, resulting in a hiatal hernia sooner. Approximately every fifth adult suffers from hiatal hernia. Many patients experience heartburn, because gastric juices can enter the oesophagus easier. Para-oesophageal hernia causes mainly symptoms due to displacement of and pressure on the abdominal organs, especially swallowing disorders and belching, but also cardiac arrhythmias.', 'Treatment generally begins with a gastroscopy. This way, a hiatal hernia can be diagnosed, but the form can’t be verified. Nonetheless, the gastroscopy is important to rule out other conditions or complications such as gastric ulcers. An x-ray in combination with swallowing a contrast medium allows the differentiation in axial or para-oesophageal hernia, or a combination of both. The treatment depends on this differentiation. An axial hiatal hernia that causes no symptoms usually doesn’t need treatment. In case of oesophageal hernia, a combination, or an axial hiatal hernia that causes symptoms, surgery should be considered to avoid complications and consequential damages.'),

If the disease spreads to the bones, it can cause strong pain.', 'Appropriate therapy is dependent on the spread and type of tumor. In early stages, surgery followed by radiation can preserve the breast and chemotherapy before the operation can be used to reduce the size of the tumor. In the case of larger tumors, the entire breast together with the lymph nodes of the underarm need to be removed, after, could be followed by chemo, hormone, or radiation therapy. Removal of the lymph nodes under the arms can cause swelling in the relevant arm. Prognosis is very dependent on how far the tumor has spread.'),

Myocarditis is a serious disease that requires a professional medical treatment because otherwise it may even lead to heart failure and death.', 'The causes of myocarditis can include: 1) Viral infection such as coxsackie, ECHO, adeno- and parvovirus, hepatitis C and HIV. 2) Bacterial infections such as chlamydia, borrelia, diphtheria and tuberculosis bacteria. 3) Fungal infections such as aspergillus and candida, 4) Parasites such as the pathogen of the Chagas disease, trypanosome cruzii, 5) Other diseases that cause an systemic inflammation such as sarcoidosis, lupus erythemtodes, scleroderma and vasculitis. 5) Illegal drugs, alcohol or medications, especially chemotherapeutic substances. People with myocarditis sometimes will have no or just mild symptoms like fatigue, malaise and loss of performance. But it can also lead to irregular or fast heartbeat, chest pain, fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. Due to the direct involvement of the heart muscle it may even lead to heart failure.', 'The treatment for myocarditis depends on the underlying cause, and may include: 1) antibiotic, antifungal, immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs, 2) cardiac glycosides and beta blockers to enhance and preserve heart function 3) diuretic drugs which can help the body to remove the excess fluid, and 4) a low-salt diet. A heart transplant or a temporary application of a cardiovascular support device might be necessary in very severe cases.'),

However, there are some common factors including the following: 1) Dehydration may result in a loss of blood volume, and easily lead to orthostatic hypotension. 2) Heart problems will make it more difficult for the heart to suddenly increase cardiac output and therefore lead to hypotension, especially during changing of position. 3) Endocrine problems, such as diabetes and adrenal insufficiency, may, directly or due to damage on the nerves, disturb the regulation of blood pressure. 4) Nervous system diseases may also disrupt the normal regulation of blood pressure, as such count Parkinson’s disease, amyloidosis and dementia. 5) Some older people may experience orthostatic hypotension after eating meals due to the distribution of blood to digestive organs. Typical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are dizziness, impaired vision (“seeing stars”) and fainting (syncope).', 'Avoiding a sudden change of position and raising slowly can prevent the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. The treatment of orthostatic hypotension will depend on the causes. For example, in the case where the cause of orthostatic syncope is dehydration, it is usually treated by the administration of fluids and electrolytes.

Examples of allergic rhinitis include: 1) Seasonal allergic rhinitis, which often results from pollen of trees and herbs that are spread in the air when the plant is blooming. This form of rhinitis is also known as hay fever. 2) Perennial allergic rhinitis, which often results from mold, dust mites and dander of animals. The common symptoms include itching in the nose, sneezing, stuffy and runny nose. Because the allergic reaction mostly also affects the conjunctivae, red and tearing eyes with dark circles around are a common symptom in allergic rhinitis.

Medications like painkiller can also relieve the symptoms.', 'Strain of the neck muscles can be caused by: 1) Improper postures, such as being hunched over to read or to use a computer, 2) Improper position during sleep, such as sleeping on a pillow that is too high or too hard. In this situation, the neck has to stretch and maintain the same posture, and strain may happen. 3) Carrying or lifting heavy things on the shoulders, which can cause overstretch of the neck muscles. 4) Traumas and injuries, which can damage or over-stretch the neck muscles, such as a fall from a height, sport accident or a car accident. Due to the initial damage on the muscles, nerve fibers are irritated and via a reflex arc this leads to a further increased contraction of the muscle. This circuit is the reason why a strain of the neck muscles takes a longer time to heal than the often little damage would let expect.', 'Once the strain happens to the neck muscles, it is recommended to follow the principles of RICE, which means to rest, to ice, to compress and to elevate. Meanwhile, pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication, muscle relaxants can also help to relieve the symptoms and give a breakthrough in the vicious circle. Massage can help the blood flow to the neck muscle and loosen the tight muscles. Heat therapy can also achieve this purpose. Immediately after damaging the muscles it is recommended to cool the area to prevent inflammation. Afterwards warming is advantageous to increase blood flow and thereby accelerate healing. It may take a few weeks for the neck muscle to recover. During this time it is better to avoid too intensive activities, which lead to pain.'),

People with the problem should visit a doctor either for medications to relieve the symptoms or surgery to improve the condition.', 'Causes of cervical spinal stenosis include the following reasons: 1) Aging: As people get older, the aging process can cause a bulging of the discs, or a thickening of ligaments (ligamentum flavum). Aging can also lead to destruction of cartilage that cover bones and to excessive growth of the bones in joints. These conditions can narrow the spinal canal and cause spinal stenosis. 2) Inherited conditions: some people are born with a narrowed spinal canal. People with cervical spinal stenosis may have symptoms as pain, numbness and stiffness or weakness in the neck, shoulder, arms, hands or legs. Typically there is only one body side affected. Sometimes balance and coordination problems such as shuffling or tripping while walking, furthermore, if the cervical spinal cord is compressed, cervical spinal stenosis can make people paralyzed or incontinent.', 'Treatment of cervical spinal stenosis can include conservative treatments like medications and exercises or modification of habits to move.

They all result from the inability of the kidney to concentrate the urine in the case of low water intake. Two types of diabetes insipidus with different causes can be distinguished: 1) Central diabetes insipidus is caused by damage to part of the pituitary gland which results in insufficient secretion of an anti-diuretic hormone. It may be caused by a tumor, trauma, and surgery or after an infection of the brain. 2) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an inadequate response of the renal tubules to the stimulations of the anti-diuretic hormone. This type is usually inherited or due to a renal disease. People with diabetes insipidus drink a lot and have to urinate often with large amounts of diluted urine.', 'The treatment for diabetes insipidus depends on its cause. Central diabetes insipidus can be treated with the intake of a synthetic anti-diuretic hormone or by treating the underlying disease.

A metabolic disorder leads to such abnormal levels of metabolites and therefore may result in some damages of brain cells, which then lead to a loss of their function. A metabolic encephalopathy can result from metabolic diseases such as imbalance of electrolytes (blood salts), hypothyroidism or other dysfunction of endocrine system, the end stage of kidney failure, severe liver diseases (cirrhosis) and many other diseases that can disrupt the normal metabolism. Besides, abuse of drugs and medications, or the toxicity of heavy metal can also result in an abnormal metabolism and lead to a brain dysfunction.

Congenital diseases of the heart valves often occur in the pulmonary valve and aortic valve, and acquired diseases of the heart valves often involve the aortic valve and mitral valve. Generally speaking, there are three common types of dysfunction of a heart valve: regurgitation, atresia and stenosis. Regurgitation occurs when the valves are unable to close adequately, and this leads to a flowing back of blood on every heartbeat. Stenosis means that the valves do not open regularly and therefore narrow the blood canal. This occurs when the valves thicken and become stiffer. Atresia means, that the channel where the valves are located is abnormally narrow and prevents blood flowing through. An often found hint for a disease of the heart valve is a heart murmur (heart sound). Depending on which valves are affected, patients may develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations or swollen ', 'The symptoms of some heart valve diseases develop slowly and are minor at the beginning.

Depending on the causes and the injured structure, people with lumbago may experience symptoms such dull or sharp pain in the area of the lower back, muscle spasms and sometimes numbness or tingling sensation in the legs. Lumbago can be either acute or chronic. Acute lumbago often occurs after an injury or trauma e.g. due to sudden movement or lifting of something heavy. Chronic lumbago is often related to aging, malposition of the spine, earlier trauma or surgery and sometimes with patients suffering from depression.', 'The treatment depends on the source of the pain. It usually aims at alleviating the pain with either pain-killers or anti-inflammatory drugs, application of warm pads and physiotherapeutic exercises with stretching and strengthening of the lower back muscles.

It disappears after quite some time. This condition is not a dangerous disease. It is just a common occurrence for men during their period of adolescence. The condition is also called hirsuties coronae glandis or pearly penile papules.', 'Hirsuties papillaris penis, which is also called hirsuties coronae or pearly penile papules, is the condition when there are small white- or flesh-colored verruciform domes forming around the penis. It is harmless to the human body. It neither is a sexually transmitted disease or a sort of warts, nor is it contagious.', 'The cause of hirsuties papillaris penis is unknown. Some researchers think it is an atavism, which means it is an occurrence of a body feature from evolutionary ancestors. It is also known that the percentage of circumcised men who have hirsuties papillaris penis is lower than those among uncircumcised men and that it occurs with increased frequency in certain families. However, the most important thing is that hirsuties papillaris penis is not caused by a sexually transmitted disease, or by bad hygiene, nor is it contagious. It is a totally harmless skin alteration. Usually it appears during the teenage years or between the ages of 20 to 40 years.', 'Since hirsuties papillaris penis is harmless and not contagious, it requires no treatment. And so far there is no medication or topical ointments that can help to remove the white-colored domes. However, if it is considered as a major cosmetic problem, one could visit a dermatologist in order to remove it with a CO2 laser.'),

A typical characteristic of the disease is a swollen scrotum.', 'A hydrocele is an over-accumulation of fluid in the scrotum. It is common in newborns for the first year of birth and usually disappears without any treatment. Older boys and adult men can develop a hydrocele due to an inflammation or injury within the scrotum, which make medical treatment necessary.', 'There are some factors that can cause the over-accumulation of fluid in the scrotum. They include: 1) With newborns: it often happens to a newborn baby due to the process of genital development inside the womb. It will improve after the birth. 2) An inguinal hernia: fluid may leak from the abdomen into the scrotum. 3) With elderly men: it often happens that there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the scrotum of elder men. 4) Extraneous influence: An infection or inflammation of the testicles. Most of the time, a hydrocele does not cause pain. People with the problem may have a swollen scrotum which looks like a balloon full of water. Normally it’s not harmful.', 'The treatments of hydrocele depend on the causes. For example, for a newborn there is no treatment required as it will improve over some period of time. If the hydrocele is caused by inguinal hernia or infections, then a surgery and/or anti-inflammatory medications and antibiotics may be necessary. However, a painless swollen scrotum should always be checked by a doctor to exclude more severe causes.'),

It is usually painless and non-cancerous.', 'A sperm cyst is a nodule (cyst) full of fluid and some dead sperm cells occurring in the epididymis. Most people with a sperm cyst do not have any symptoms. A sperm cyst usually does not need to be treated if it has no symptoms. Once the cyst starts to grow bigger and causes discomfort, it is recommended to visit an urologist for a further examination.', 'The exact causes of a sperm cyst are still unknown. It is likely that a sperm cyst can develop when there is a blockage in the epididymis. Besides, other factors to cause a sperm cyst may include 1) injuries and blunt trauma, 2) an infection of epididymis (epididymitis) and 3) a non-infectious inflammation. Many people with a sperm cyst may not feel any obvious symptoms, and normally it will not bring any negative effects. However, once the symptoms start to appear, patients may feel pain in the testis, abdominal pain, blood in semen, pain after ejaculation, difficulty in urination, pain during urination and increase in frequency of urination.', 'Many people with sperm cysts do not have any symptoms and do not feel pain and discomfort. For these cases, treatments may not be necessary. However, once the symptoms are accompanied with swelling and pain or when the cysts start to grow uncontrollably, then it is recommended to get a proper treatment. The common treatments of sperm cysts include: 1) Medications such as oral analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. 2) Aspiration: it can be used to remove the extra fluid in the epididymis. 3) A surgery: it is necessary to remove the cysts in the epididymis for certain severe cases.

(511, 'Kidney failure is a condition where the kidney loses normal functions. It can be classified as either acute kidney failure or chronic kidney failure. Acute kidney failure develops rapidly but might be curable and reversible. Chronic kidney failure usually develops gradually over years and it is not reversible.', 'A kidney failure is present when the kidney is severely damaged and can therefore no more fulfill its task. Depending on how rapidly it developed, it is classified as either acute or chronic kidney failure. Acute kidney failure occurs within hours or days and may be cured, but once it becomes chronic then it will most likely be permanent. People with chronic kidney failure therefore may need dialysis regularly or accept a kidney transplant.', 'Kidney failure can be either acute or chronic. The causes of acute kidney failure are usually due to sudden damage to the kidney such as 1) a traumatic injury with high blood loss, 2) a sudden reduction in blood flow to the kidneys, 3) shock or sepsis, 4) obstruction of the urinary system, 5) damage from certain drugs or toxins, and 6) pregnancy complications. Chronic kidney failure develops gradually on the basis of certain disease. For example, the causes of chronic kidney failure include 1) immune system diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or C, 2) urinary tract infection such as pyelonephritis, 3) chronic inflammation of the kidneys, 4) polycystic kidney disease, 5) congenital defects, 6) drugs and toxins, 7) diabetes and high blood pressure. People with kidney failure may have excessive accumulation of fluid in the body, and have symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, seizure, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and headache. It can also result in a loss of consciousness. Untrea', 'The treatment of kidney failure will depend on the conditions. An acute kidney failure will be treated according to the causes. For example, if it is caused by an infection, then antibiotics and a temporary dialysis can help the kidney to recover. However, if the kidney failure is chronic, the kidney will not gain back its function and the treatment may include substitutive procedures such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation.'),

Damage to the articular cartilage or labrum and limited range of motion can be the result.', 'Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) describes painful bumping (impingement) of the femoral head and the acetabulum. It is the result of an abnormal shape of the femoral head, the acetabulum or both. It can cause pain and complicate hip movements. The treatment includes conservative and surgical therapies.', 'The primary cause of femoroacetabular impingement is an abnormal shape of the femoral head or acetabulum. It is commonly classified into 3 forms including 1) cam impingement: this is a deformity of the ball-like shape of the femoral head. If the head is not shaped normally, the abnormal part of the head may jam in the socket (acetabulum) when the hip is bent, 2) pincer impingement: This is a deformity of the acetabulum. If the front rim of the acetabulum protrudes too far, the neck of the femur may collide with the rim of the acetabulum during normal hip movement, 3) mixed impingement: this is a deformity resulting in a combination of cam and pincer impingement. People with FAI may have symptoms such as pain in the groin or gluteal area. The symptoms can typically be triggered by climbing stairs, walking uphill and sitting for longer time. Commonly affected are children and adults who do a lot of sports.', 'The treatment of FAI may include either conservative or surgical treatment. Conservative treatments include 1) activity changes: avoiding activities that cause symptoms, 2) non-steroid anti-inflammation medication: they reduce the inflammation and pain, 3) physical therapy: this may help relieve stress on the injured labrum or cartilage. If the symptoms cannot be relieved by nonsurgical treatment, early surgical treatment should be considered. Especially in cases with minor deformations, surgery can be done minimally invasive with arthroscopy.'),
(513, 'Pelvic bones include the bones of hip, coccyx and sacrum. And a pelvic fracture is a disruption happening to any of these pelvic bones. The structure of the pelvis is like a ring with bones situated between the legs and the spine at the lower part of the trunk. Such structure means that when a fracture occurs in a part of it, another part is also affected with injury to ligaments or a fracture. There are numerous common patterns of pelvic fracture. Each pattern is influenced by the direction of the fracture and the intensity of the force behind the fracture. Since the pelvis is close to important organs and blood vessels, fractures that occur in this structure can cause important damages and extensive bleeding which necessitates urgent care.', 'A pelvic fracture is a disruption of the bony structures, which happens in the pelvis. However, pelvic fractures can be caused by many reasons, but most pelvic fractures result from high-energy forces such as a motorbike accident or fall from a height. An immediate medical treatment is necessary when pelvic fractures happen.', 'The causes of pelvic fractures include: 1) Avulsion fracture: these fractures usually occur when there is a sudden muscle contraction happening. Some pieces of pelvic bones will be torn away by the contractions of muscles. 2) Osteoporosis: elder people with osteoporosis have higher risks of getting pelvic fractures. Osteoporosis can result in the fractures because of the weakened bony structure. However, it will not damage the whole structure of the pelvic ring, but certain weak parts of the pelvic bones. 3) High-energy forces: this is the most common reason of getting pelvic fractures. For example, car accidents, a sudden high-energy force or fall from a height. The type of pelvic fracture can be very dangerous. It is very important to seek a medical treatment immediately. The common symptoms include pain, swelling and bruise of the pelvis.', 'The treatments of pelvic fractures depend on the causes and the severity of the damage determines the care for a pelvic fracture. Fractures from low energy can be handled often with conservative treatment. The avulsion fracture may heal spontaneously, but the patient will need to use a walker to avoid too much stress on the pelvis. For some severe pelvic fractures caused by high energy  impact, such as fractures caused by accidents, a surgery is usually necessary because this kind of fracture often is accompanied by extensive bleeding and surgery will also be needed in order to rebuild the pelvis with the objective to restore stability that will enable the patients to restart their regular activities. Besides, medication such as pain reliever can help to relieve the discomforts.'),
(514, 'The parathyroid glands are four small pea-shaped glands located on the boarders of the thyroid gland in the neck. They mainly produce the parathyroid hormone. The function of the parathyroid hormone includes the control of the level of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D in the blood and bones. Hyperparathyroidism occurs when there is too much parathyroid hormone produced, which results in high level of calcium in the blood.', 'Hyperparathyroidism describes a condition in which there is too much parathyroid hormone produced by the parathyroid glands. The causes of hyperparathyroidism are various. It is recommended to visit a doctor to clarify the cause and accept a proper treatment.', 'Hyperparathyroidism can be classified in three different types according to its cause. 1) primary hyperparathyroidism: It is caused by an hyperplasia (abnormal mass) or a tumor in the parathyroid gland that produces parathyroid hormones autonomically. Women and people with family history will have higher risks of getting this problem. 2.) secondary hyperparathyroidism: It is the result of other  medical conditions such as kidney failure, disorders of liver or gut function, vitamin D deficiency and rickets. 3) tertiary hyperparathyroidism: it develops after years of a secondary hyperparathyroidism. The intake of lithium, a common medication for psychiatric disorders, can have a side effect that looks similar to a primary hyperparathyroidism. People with hyperparathyroidism usually have symptoms like pain in bones, vulnerability for fractures, increased amount of urine, kidney and bladder stones, fatigue and loss of appetite.', 'Treatments of hyperparathyroidism will depend on the causes. The high blood level of calcium and parathyroid hormone can be adjusted by low calcium and low phosphate diet and with medications such as calcitriol and cinacalcet. Drinking enough water can prevent the development of kidney stones. The degradation of bone mass can be reduced with medications like bisphosphonates and, for women, estrogen-like substances. Besides, regular exercise can strengthen the bones. When the hyperparathyroidism is caused by a medical condition, then the treatment is aimed at treating the underlying disease. In case of hyperplasia or a benign tumor, surgery will be foreseen. If the hyperparathyroidism is caused by cancer, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary.'),
(515, 'Accident-related bone fractures can be a disruption in any part of human bones. The disruption results from accidents. The form of the fracture also depends on how the bones are broken.', 'Accident-related bone fracture describes a fracture, which happens with a sudden accident. An accident-related bone fracture could occur in every part where a body has bones. Often it requires an emergency medical treatment or surgery. Later even a rehabilitation can be necessary.', 'Accident-related bone fractures are a common consequence of car crashes or other unexpected accidents, which cause extreme force to be exerted on the bones. Serious broken bones injuries include pelvic fractures, fractures to the sternum or ribs, spine and skull fractures. A fracture of the forearm (Radius) is most frequently. Other common types of broken bone injuries include fractures of the ankle, femur, collarbone, and hand. Forms of fractures vary; in general they include 1) buckle or greenstick fracture (an incomplete fracture with intact periosteum on one side, which only occurs in children), 2) hairline/stress fracture, 3) rotation fracture, 4) avulsion fracture, 5) oblique fracture, 6) comminuted fracture and 7) compound fracture.', 'Treatment of accident-related fractures often requires surgery as the injuries often include multiple fractures or crush injuries and a high blood loss. Due to this, reconstructive surgery may be required. Most important is reconstruction of length, axis and rotation of the bone. Depending on what bones were broken, recovery could take a substantial amount of time, and rehabilitation may also be needed. Besides surgery, medication such as antibiotics (in open fractures) and analgesics can be considered for relieving pain or prevent bacterial infections.'),
(516, 'Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bones, which is most often caused by bacterium such as staphylococcus aureus, but other bacteria may also cause osteomyelitis.

The main cause are bacterial infections due to open fractures or operations. It usually requires anti-infection medication such as antibiotic drugs and sometimes even an operation to remove the infected tissue.', 'The causes of osteomyelitis are mainly the infections caused by bacteria. Depending on the origins of the infection, it can be classified into: 1) Infections through the blood stream: once there are certain bacteria in the blood, the pathogenic germs can enter the bone via the bloodstream. It is the most common way for children to get an osteomyelitis. 2) Direct infections: open fractures will result in an open wound on the bone, and bacteria can break into the bone directly and result in an infection. People who underwent bone surgery may also have higher risks of getting direct infections. 3) Infections from nearby infected tissues: when bacteria enter the body’s tissues through a superficial wound, the bacteria can travel through the tissue to the bones and result in an osteomyelitis. People with osteomyelitis may suffer from symptoms such as pain (especially at night), redness, warmth and swelling of the affected limp, as well as fever and chills.', 'The treatment of osteomyelitis includes medication and surgery. Medication such as antibiotic drugs are often used to treat the infections. However, it is important to identify the specific pathogenic germ in order to predict which antibiotic works best. For severe and chronic cases, surgery to repair or to remove affected bone parts is necessary.'),

Periostitis improves often with rest but the condition can lead to chronic pain and discomfort. Infection of the bone can lead to acute periostitis that is a painful condition and can lead to necrosis, or death of the living tissue nearby the bone. Chronic periostitis can result from stress and trauma to the bones. An example of this condition is shin splints from running.', 'Periostitis is inflammation of the periosteum, which is the connective tissue that covers and protects the bones. The inflammation may occur due to mechanical reasons or an infection. It usually may be treated symptomatically. Surgery is rarely necessary to remove infected tissue.', 'The causes of periostitis are the following: 1) mechanical: an injury or overuse may cause inflammation, 2) infection: often associated with infection of the bone by different type of bacteria. It most often occurs on the medial side of the tibia due to overuse. People with periostitis may experience pain and swelling in the affected area. Infections may cause redness of the skin and sometimes fever.', 'Treatment usually consists of symptomatic therapy with rest, icing, painkillers or anti-inflammatories and taping. In case of an infection antibiotic treatment is necessary. If the bone itself is also infected (osteomyelitis) surgery to remove the infected tissue will be required.'),

It can cause acute but also chronic inflammation and result in anal abscess or fistula. A suspected inflammation of the anal glands should be consulted with a doctor.', 'Cause of anal gland inflammation is an infection by bacteria in a deep wrinkle of the anal mucosa (crypt), in which the anal glands lead. The infection is mainly caused by fecal residues, which always contain lots of bacteria. Common symptoms include redness, tenderness, fever and pain of the infected area.

Under the latter circumstance, a surgical drainage and resection is normally necessary and hospitalization may be needed for a further examination.', 'The cause of an anal abscess is a bacterial infection that mostly occurs in obstructed anal glands. During the process of infections, pus may start to form in the affected area and become an anal abscess as it forms an artificial cavity where once was the anal gland. People with an anal abscess may experience swelling, pain and redness around the affected area. Sometimes pus pours out of the abscess. Furthermore, fever, chills, fatigue and general weakness may happen, too. Over time an anal abscess can also result in a fistula, which will form a canal from the infected cavity (abscess) to the surface of the skin.', 'The treatment of an anal abscess is mainly to remove the pus out of the infected area. A surgical drainage is often performed to drain the pus out from the affected anal gland. Also the whole cavity should be removed, because otherwise the recurrence of an abscess is very likely. Meanwhile, medications such as antibiotics may be used to prevent further infections. Hospitalization is often recommended for a detailed examination.'),

Nowadays it is supposed that these pains develop due to small injuries in the muscle fibrils, the contracting elements of a muscle cell.', 'Muscle soreness describes pain in the muscles that appears several hours after intense muscle work and lasts for few days. The reason for this is most likely the appearance of small injuries (micro traumata) in the motoric structures of the muscle fibers during overstressing. The relieving factors for muscle soreness include medication, mild massages and local warming.', 'On the cause of muscle soreness is not yet fully agreed. The theory of accumulation of lactic acid being responsible for pain seems disproven since the amount of pain does not correlate with the amount of lactic acid. Furthermore, at the time the pain occurs, the accumulated lactic acid is already degraded for the most part. More probable seems that small injuries (micro traumata) in the z-line of the muscular fibrils are responsible for muscle soreness. Due to these injuries the muscle cells start to swell and to build inflammatory substances. Because there are no nerve endings in a muscle fiber, the injury cannot be felt at the time of their incidence. But now, when the swelling goes back and the inflammatory substances are flushed out, the nerves get in contact with these substances and start to signalize pain. This happens about 12-24 hours after overstressing.', 'The relieving factors for muscle soreness are mainly medications, physical therapies and heat application. Medications such as painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve the discomforts that muscle soreness brings. Physical therapies, such as mild massages of affected muscles, and heat application, such as warm packing or a warm bath, will stimulate the blood circulation and therefore accelerate the process of healing.');

In addition, drinking alcohol, fatigue, smoking and stress can increase the risks of getting labyrinthitis. The inner ear is important for hearing and body balance. Therefore, once there is an inflammation within the inner ear, it can cause the inner ear become swollen and irritated and then result in loss of hearing and disturbance in balance. The common symptoms of labyrinthitis include feelings like spinning, loss of balance and hearing, difficulty in focusing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and even a tinnitus (noise or ringing) in the affected ear.', 'Proper treatment can help to fight the underlying cause and to reduce the symptoms of dizziness and vertigo. Medications like antiviral drugs, antibiotics, sedatives and steroids are, depending on the cause, used to treat labyrinthitis. Other medications that can reduce the symptoms of nausea and vomiting including prochlorperazine, and to relieve the symptoms of dizziness, meclizine is also commonly prescribed. With proper treatment, symptoms of labyrinthitis can improve within a few weeks and can achieve full recovery in a month or two.

A pair of glasses, lenses or a proper eye laser surgery can solve the problem.', 'The causes of astigmatism are mainly an irregular shape of the cornea or an abnormal curvature of the lens. Once the shape of the cornea or the lens becomes irregular, the light cannot be bundled in a single point and will therefore not focus properly on the retinal. As a result, it will lead to a blurred vision at any distance. Astigmatism can be either congenital or acquired. A congenital astigmatism is present from birth, and often comes together with other problems in the optic system such as farsightedness or nearsightedness. An acquired astigmatism can occur due to a disease of the cornea or after an eye surgery, for example, cataract surgery.', 'The treatments of astigmatism include a proper pair of glasses, lenses and eye laser surgery. A customized pair of glasses or individually adapted lenses can compensate the irregularities in the optic system and help to adjust the light to focus properly on the retina. Nearsightedness or farsightedness can be adjusted at the same time. Up to a certain degree of severity, these adjustments can also be achieved with eye laser surgery. In this case the shape of the cornea will be modified in order to compensate for the refraction error. After all, make sure to discuss the possibilities of treatment with an oculist.'),

For some people, the scar tissue will grow excessively or even keep forming after the wound has healed. This extra scar tissue will result in a red or flesh-colored, raised scar on the skin, which is called a keloid. Keloids do not usually hurt, but they may cause itchiness or sensitivity of the skin.', 'A keloid describes excessive scar tissue, which is firm, smooth, irregular and raised on the skin. The scar is not harmful to the human body. Treatment is therefore not necessary. However, there are ways to remove the scar.', 'The causes of keloids are any injuries or damage to the skin, which can result in wounds. During the process of healing, scar tissue will repair the injured area. If the scar overgrows and becomes raised on the skin, then it is considered as a keloid. Keloids often occur on the skin of the upper trunk, arms, legs, ears and neck, and will appear at the site of a previous wound. A keloid is firm, smooth, has irregular nodules, and the color can be either red or the color of the skin. The common conditions that can cause keloids include acne, burns, chickenpox, scratches, surgical wounds, trauma wounds, and vaccinations.', 'Keloids normally do not need any treatment. However, the following treatments can help to reduce cosmetic issues due to the size of the scar: 1) corticosteroid injection, 2) cryotherapy, 3) laser treatment, 4) radiation, 5) surgical removal, and 6) silicone gel.

If one eats more sugar than the body needs at that time, the pancreas releases insulin, which makes muscles and liver store the excessive part. When the blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone (glucagon) tells the liver to release glucose.', 'Hypoglycemia, describes a condition characterized by an abnormal low level of blood sugar, which is the body’s main energy source. Causes of hypoglycemia are various. Consulting a specialist for a further investigation of the cause can help to avoid undergoing hypoglycemia.', 'People with diabetes typically suffer from low blood sugar level. They will usually take medicine that increases insulin levels in the body. In diabetes patients factors like taking too much diabetes medication, skipping meals, eating less than normal, or excessive exercising are common causes that lead to a hypoglycemia. Besides, alcohol consumption, illness, insulin overproduction (due to a tumor), or other endocrine dysfunctions can lead to low blood sugar levels. Without enough glucose, the body cannot perform its normal function. Normally it is defined as hypoglycemia when the blood sugar level drops below 70 mg/dl. The common symptoms include blurry vision, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, pale skin, headache, hunger, shaking, sweating, and finally even loss of consciousness. A big problem is that patients will feel these symptoms very late or misconstrue them and therefore be unable to consume some sugar before the loss of consciousness occurs.', 'In acute phase the intake of glucose has highest priority. Either by consuming sugar containing drinks and food or, in case of lost consciousness, by an infusion. Further treatments of hypoglycemia depend on its causes. For example, if the medications caused hypoglycemia, then the doctor will adjust the dose. If one has a certain tumor such as pancreas tumor, it will be treated by surgical removal. If one has diabetes, the doctor’s prescription should be followed and the blood sugar should be checked regularly. If none of the causes apply, the lifestyle may be the cause for the hypoglycemia. In case of hypoglycemia consulting a doctor for a proper treatment way is recommended.'),

Common symptoms include symmetrical difficulty in hearing and a ringing (tinnitus) in the ears.', 'Treatment is focused on improving daily hearing function, like using hearing aids, telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices. In severe cases speech reading (lip reading) and sign languages can also help. Sometimes a doctor will recommend a cochlear implant for those with nearly complete hearing loss, which is very uncommon for presbycusis. A surgery will be necessary to place an implant. An implant can help an almost deaf person with functional hearing nerve detect sounds again. With practice it can allow people to understand speech, but it does not restore the normal hearing.'),

It is recommended to consult a neurologist, if respective symptoms appear.', 'The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown. Some researches show that narcolepsy may be related to low levels of hypocretin (orexin), which is neurotransmitter in the brain. This may be the reason for the deregulation of the sleep-wake cycles. The low concentration of hypocretin is thought to be associated with a loss of brain cells that produce hypocretin due to some autoimmune reactions. Whether other factors such as vaccinations, a trauma or injury to the brain, tumors in the brain, stress, an irregular sleep schedule, and abuse of medications or any other damage to the brain can result in narcolepsy, is not finally proven. The common symptoms include extreme daytime sleepiness (sleep attacks despite sufficient amount of sleep), cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone while retaining consciousness, triggered by a emotional stimulus such as joy or fright), hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations directly after awakening), as well as sleep paralysis (inability to move directly after awa', 'Lifestyle changes, called sleep hygiene, can help to reduce the symptoms of narcolepsy, for example: 1) a regular sleep schedule, 2) keeping the bedroom dark during sleep, 3) avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, 4) not smoking, 5) doing something relaxing to fall asleep before bedtime, 6) regular exercise. Individually assessed strategies like daily sleeping episodes or the avoidance of certain situations will help to handle the disease. In addition, medications might be used for the treatment of narcolepsy, for example, 1) stimulant medicines, such as methylphenidate or modafenil, can help to stay awake during the day, 2) antidepressant medicines can help to reduce cataplexy, sleep paralysis and even hallucinations, 3) sodium oxybate can also help to control day time sleepiness and cataplexy.

People with congenital ptosis may not fully open the affected eye and may have impaired vision.', 'A ptosis is usually mild and vision will not be impaired which means no treatment will be required. However, it is recommended to have surgery early in order to correct the  condition if it is serious and impairs the vision. It is better to have the procedure performed when the infant is not less than three years old as the eyelid is then a little bigger. This makes it easier to work with it. In case of a severe droop which blocks the vision, a surgery can be required urgently for the baby to allow him to have a regular vision.

For example, car accidents, falls or being attacked by a fist or weapon can result in rib fractures due to the trauma happening to the chest. Besides, illnesses such as osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism or bone metastases can weaken the bone structure and therefore increase the risks of getting rib fractures. Such weakened ribs can even break due to coughing. Rib fractures can be classified as single, multiple or comminuted fracture. People with a rib fracture may feel pain around the chest; furthermore, the pain typically worsens when people take a deep breath, touch the affected area or move their body.

Typical symptoms of esophageal spasm are globus sensation in the throat, pain in the chest and regurgitation of food. 2) Dysfunctions of the lower esophagus can result from either a high or a low muscular contraction of the esophagus and its lower sphincter. If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too strong, while the peristaltic smooth muscle waves are too weak, it will prevent the food from passing into the stomach, so it gets stuck in the esophagus (achalasia).

In addition, some medicine can trigger the virus to be active again and this can cause a shingles rash. The mechanism is not clear but once triggered, the virus causes only shingles, not chickenpox. Symptoms of shingles occur in phases. Sensitivity to light or headache, flu without fever are common at the beginning. Later, the patient may feel pain, tingling, or itching in some areas and a few days later, a small spot of rash will appear there. The rash will turn into clusters of blisters filled with fluid before they crust over. The blisters heal generally within two to four weeks and they may leave scars. The symptoms vary as some peo', 'There are medicines to treat shingles and these medicines include pain and antiviral medicines. An early treatment with antiviral medicine can help that the rash heals quickly and is less painful. The affected person can also made feel better quickly with a good home care. The skin sores should be kept clean and it is recommended to call a doctor if the pain bothers the affected perons. If suited the doctor can prescribe pain medicine.'),
(657, 'Chlamydia infection is a bacterial infection. Since it is a sexually transmitted disease, both men and women may get the infection through sexual contacts. People who are infected with chlamydia infections often do not have obvious symptoms.', 'Chlamydia infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. It is a bacterial infection. The disease can be diagnosed by a lab test and should be treated immediately to avoid further complications. Since the cause of chlamydia infection is bacterial, the treatment of chlamydia infection is normally antibiotics.', 'The cause of the infection are bacteria, which are called chlamydia trachomatis. The bacteria are passed onto someone else through contact with the genitals or the rectum during sexual intercourse. They lead to infections in the urogenital tract or rectal area. In men they can cause urethritis, epididymitis, proctitis and prostatitis. In woman they can cause urethritis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). If a woman has PID, it may lead to infertility or problems during pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is infected with chlamydia, the baby may get a bacterial eye infection or pneumonia. Generally speaking, chlamydia infection often does not cause obvious symptoms. These minor symptoms may include lower abdominal pain, pain during urination, yellow-whitish discharge and itchiness of genitals and, rarely, fever and chills.', 'Since the cause of chlamydia infection is bacteria, the treatment is mainly antibiotics. It is strongly recommended to avoid sexual contact during the period of treatment and it is necessary that the partner is treated as well. A regular follow-up is necessary for people who had chlamydia infection to avoid the recurrence, especially women who wish to fall pregnant.');
