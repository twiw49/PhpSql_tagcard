Also, they include an overuse of cleaning agents and sanitizers, over-washing with harsh soaps, the evaporation of water after a swim or bath, improper use or choice of moisturizers and some medicine such as drugs for acne, allergies, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Internal causes include a personal medical history of other diseases such as atopic dermatitis, genetically caused conditions, and age related issues or the overall health situation of a person. People with thyroid diseases are more disposed to developing dry skin. The symptoms and signs include red plaques, rough dry skin and itching.', 'For treatment of dry skin, it’s recommend that the affected peron uses an oil-based product when bathing instead of the usual soap product. After bathing, one should apply a moisturizing cream to the skin that will reestablish the skin’s barrier. After that he can use a store-bought body lotion for daily treatment.

It is not a disease, but rather a natural sign of advanced age that is related to the interruption of proper functioning of the eye’s lens.', 'The decline in clarity of vision of things nearby is noticed predominantly while reading. Reading material must be held farther and farther from the eye in order to keep the text clear and legible. The reason for presbyopia is the increasing rigidity of the lens, which in younger years allows us to see things clearly at a distance from about 10 cm. This distance increases up to 4m with age due to the lack of flexibility in the lens if left uncorrected.', 'Correcting presbyopia is simple and involves magnifying lenses, no matter what your previous or current prescription for corrective lenses is.

Spinal discs lose elasticity with age and can tear with sudden, awkward movements while carrying heavy loads (e.g. lifting heavy weights with a bent back) and then bulge out into the spinal canal. This compresses the spinal nerve root. The lumbar vertebrae are usually the ones affected (technically known at L5/S1, L4/L5)', 'A herniated disc (or a slipped disc) is a medical condition in which a part of the disc between the vertebrae of the spine protrudes out and puts pressure on the nerve of the spinal cord. This causes a radiating pain.', 'Patients usually feel pain in the lumbar vertebrae after a clumsy movement. The pain then spreads to the buttocks, then the upper thigh, and can even radiate down the entire leg. In serious cases, patients may experience lack of sensation or even paralysis.', 'After having the herniated disc confirmed through special imaging (MRI, magnetic resonance imaging), pain medication and bed rest can help to reduce pain.

The measles can remain undetected for several years after the initial attack and attack the brain, which can lead to death.', 'To prevent measles, an effort to vaccinate the entire population is being undertaken to protect from the consequences of the infection. Two shots are required, the first one at 12 months of age and the second at 15-24 months. The shot is combined with other vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). If an infection with measles occurs, the infected child should not be allowed contact with other children for 5 days after the outbreak of the rash to prevent the infection from spreading. People who have come in contact with the infected child (classmates, for example) and who have not had measles or been vaccinated against them should stay at home for 14 days for the same reason.

Since then, the incidence of mumps had been reduced dramatically. Measles or chickenpox are more infectious than mumps and adults who are not vaccinated are more likely to experience complications than children. However, mumps causes rarely serious issues. The disease is highly contagious since the airborne droplets transmit the virus.', 'Mumps is an infection triggered by a virus in the salivary glands. In particular the parotid glands are attacked.

There are various tests that can show whether a person got infected, a few weeks after an infection. An HIV infection is very burdensome for the patient and his surroundings. Today\'s therapy options can postpone the break-out of AIDS for a long time, and patients can attain an almost normal life span. The following recommendations should be followed to reduce the risk of an HIV infection as much as possible: Always use a condom when having sex, no blood or semen inside the mouth as well as being careful when handling blood or syringes. Special arrangements are made for pregnant ladies (treatment of mother and child with medication, birth via C-section, no breastfeeding), to avoid an infection of the child.', 'If there is a risk that an infection occurred, a specialist doctor should be consulted (a doctor specializing in infectiology or internal medicine) to discuss further steps. An accurate measurement of blood levels is always necessary to determine the start of the therapy with special medication.

The inflammation of the urethra, or urethritis, is different from an infection of the urinary track. The two conditions are not treated the same way even if their symptoms are similar. Urethral discharge (pus) and a burning sensation during urination are common symptoms.', 'Young people who often changes partners are often affected. The patient may notice a pus-like discharge in the morning (especially with gonorrhea), and itching, burning, or pain when urinating. It is however not uncommon absence of symptoms, which means that sexual partners often do not realize that they have been infected.', 'If left untreated, the inflammation can reach the prostate and seminal vesicles in men and the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries in women. Additionally, the risk of developing infertility is increased for women in the case of infection by certain pathogens (especially with chlamydia). The exact type of bacteria can be confirmed with a swabbing of the urethra. The infection can then be treated with antibiotics.

('c__122', 'Inflammation of the veins is often caused by chronic stasis of the blood in pre-existing varicose veins in the legs or from an injury to the vein (from an infusion or shot). Phlebitis happens because there are clots of blood located in the vein or the walls of the vein are damaged. When the damaged vein is located close to the surface of the skin, the condition is called superficial phlebitis. Blood clots can also form in deeper veins such as the ones located in the legs and in varicose veins. When the blood clots occurs in the inflamed zone, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is a condition that can be life-threatening since it comes from blood clots located in deep veins.', 'Veins are blood vessels that bring the blood back to the heart. Inflammation of superficial veins usually occurs due to pre-existing varicose veins or after injury to a vein (from an infusion or injection). A blood clot may also develop in the affected part of the vein while it is inflamed. Inflammation of the vein is most common in the legs, but is also (though less) likely to develop in the arms after an infusion treatment. Swelling occurs in the area around the infected vein and is red, warm, and painful.', 'The cause of superficial phlebitis is often unclear. The condition can result from a medical procedure including the use of an intravenous catheter or line. Minor injuries caused to present varicose veins can also cause superficial phlebitis. Numerous factors can trigger deep vein thrombosis such as clotting disorders, damage to the inner lining of the vein, genetics, some forms of cancer, paralysis that makes the person inactive for a long period of time, prolonged inactivity including sitting for a long moment in a plane or car or lying for longer periods in bed following a surgery, and any condition that slows the blood stream. Symptoms vary depending on the inflammation site. Superficial phlebitis comes with symptoms including light fever, burning or itching in the inflamed area, swelling, tenderness, or warmth in affected zone, and redness along the canal of the vein. If the affected zone is lowered, such as the leg, specifically in the morning, this can worsen the symptoms. Superficial phlebitis is rarely serious but uncomfortable. In case of clotting, the affected vein feels cold or hard beneath the skin. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is often without symptoms. The rare symptoms include swelling, redness, and warmth in the inflamed zone. This form of phlebitis is dangerous since the clot of blood stuck in the vein can move and head to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain potentially able to cause death.', 'Complications may arise, such as the movement or growth of blood clots from the superficial veins to deeper ones or the formation of pus-filled infection from bacteria. The patient should exercise the affected leg and support the inflamed vein with compression bandaging. If a large vein is affected or if the patient is bedridden, blood-thinning medication should be implemented.'),

Normally, these bacteria live on the skin without causing any harm but they can penetrate the skin through a sore or a cut and cause an infection. Some conditions such as eczema and athlete’s foot may cause breaks in the skin and lead sometimes to erysipelas. The condition can also happen following an infection in the throat and nose that allows the bacteria to spread to nasal passages. Other causes include insect bites, swollen legs due to diabetes and heart failure, and some skin conditions such as psoriasis, injection of illegal drugs such as heroin, surgical incisions, and ulcers in the skin. Typically, symptoms of erysipelas include swollen glands, blisters on the affected area, a painful, swollen, and red area of skin with an elevated edge, feeling generally unwell, chills and fever. The swollen area includes generally both cheeks and the nose when erysipelas affects a person\'s face.', 'Depending on the severity of the condition, the treatment plan can include home remedies such as keeping the affected area lifted higher than the rest of the body to reduce swelling, drinking plenty of fluids, getting up and walking around often. Some cases of erysipelas may need medications such as antibiotics, painkillers to treat the fever and reduce the discomfort. If erysipelas has progressed fast and causes healthy tissue to die, surgery can be required to remove the dead tissue.');

However, if a paronychia is not treated, then the infection may become serious and can even lead to a partial or total loss of a person\'s nail.', 'Paronychia is a skin infection around the toenails and fingernails with pus, redness and pain. The infection is bacterial and is caused by a yeast named Candida which is causing the Paronychia. Yeast and bacteria can even combinedly lead to one infection.', 'There are various causes of paronychia. The infection can either develop fast and occur acutely around the fingernails or show up slowly and become chronic on a person\'s toes or fingers. The reason for both is a bacteria, named Candida, or the mixture of the two bacterial agents. A bactery can penetrate the skin at the border of the nail through any kind of trauma such as cause by biting nails, being punctured by a manicurist tool, pushing down the cuticle too aggressively or further sorts of similar injuries. This leads to an acute infection. Chronic infection is also caused by Candida yeast but a bacteria can also be the origin. Since yeast grows well on wet environments, this chronic infection is caused often by having the hands or feet in water for a long period of time. The symptoms of both chronic and acute paronychia are very similar and include blisters filled with pus, redness and tenderness of the skin around the nail, changes in the shape, texture, and color of the nail, as well as detachment of the nail.', 'To prevent paronychia care should be taken by keeping the hands and feet clean to stop bacteria from slipping between skin and nails. One can prevent acute infections by avoiding trauma caused by pedicures, manicures, or biting. Also long exposure to wet environments and water helps to prevent a chronic infection. Home treatments are often very effective for mild cases. Soaking the infected area numerous times per day in hot water and applying antibiotic ointment is recommended. If the infection is not showing improvement with home treatments or if it is more severe, a doctor can prescribe an antibiotic to be taken orally. It might also be needed to have abscesses or blisters cut and drained of fluids in order to speed the healing and relieving the discomfort. '),

Anal fissure does not lead to more serious issues. It is a common problem that affects people of all ages, particularly also young and healthy people.', 'An anal fissure can develop due to constipation or diarrhea, after giving birth, from certain sexual practices (such as anal sex), or due to other medical issues with the anus. An anal fissure is very painful and leads to increased tension in the sphincter of the anus. This in turn worsens constipation and creates a negative feedback loop. An anal fissure may bleed or even cause itching.', 'The danger of anal fissures is that symptoms remain unhealed (and become chronic).

Family history is also among the causes of farsightedness. The condition develops often in adults as the lenses of the eyes age. It is difficult for people with farsightedness to see anything up close. They have to work hard in order to see close things and this causes strain in the eyes. This extra strain causes some symptoms of farsightedness.

When the condition has not been corrected and diagnosed properly in children, some of them may develop strabismus or crossed eyes.', 'The eyes of young people can compensate for farsightedness since their lenses are still flexible. This is hard for aging eyes that require glasses for close-up tasks including sewing or reading. The condition can be corrected in the simplest way by getting prescription contact lenses or eyeglasses with converging lenses (“plus” lenses). Such lenses or eyeglasses are corrective as they change the way light enters the eyes and compensating the insufficient refractive power of the lens, helping the patient to concentrate better. Another way to treat farsightedness is refractive surgery that may cause some severe complications.'),
('c__144', 'Superficial mycosis is when the skin, mucous membranes, or nails are affected. If the fungus affects organs deeper in the body, then it is referred to as a systemic mycosis. Fungi that cause superficial mycosis are divided into three groups: dermatophytes, yeast, and molds. Molds usually only affect people with compromised immune systems. An infection by dermatophytes or yeast can occur in the context of diabetes or pregnancy. Yeasts colonize warm and moist areas of mucous membranes and skin folds. Skin folds, the mouth, genitals, and nail cuticles are susceptible to a fungal attack for this reason. Molds possess active components that can destroy callused human skin and eclusively attack the skin, hair, and nails. Fungi are found in soil, on animals, and can be transmitted between people.', 'Mycosis is a fungal infection of animals and humans. Mycoses are common and its development can be assisted by a variety of physiological conditions. Mycoses start often on the skin (superficial) or in the lungs (systemic) and affect millions of people.', 'Depending on the location of the fungal attack, the skin may show different signs of infection. A yeast infection manifests as a reddish, inflamed area of skin surrounded by flaking. A fungal infection of the mucous membranes in the mouth can produce a white film that can be wiped away, with a felty feeling as well as troubles to taste. A fungal infection on the genitals is accompanied by itching and discharge in women and itchy, white nodes and blisters in men. An infection by mold produces disc-shaped foci that have an elevated, reddened, and flaky margin. If the infection is located between the toes, then the skin is white and chapped. An infection of the scalp with hair presents either on the entire scalp or in several areas as redness with dry flaking and hair loss. An attack on the nails can happen via small injuries or from circulation disorders and manifests as yellowing and thickening of the nails.', 'The key for favorable results are early diagnosis, prompt use of appropriate antifungal treatment, and efforts to enhance the immune system. Antifungal drugs, usually creams, are prescribed to treat mycoses, except for example in the case of an infection of the nails and head. Most of the drugs are over-the-counter medicine. Some drugs can be administered intravenously for fungal infections that show resistance to other types of treatment. For fungal infections of the feet, keeping the feet dry is especially important to treatment.'),

During childhood, the redness mainly occurs in the face, throat and neck, and is especially strong on the crook of the arm and the hollow of the knee, as well as the backs of hands and feet. The other skin is usually very dry. The often agonizing itching leads to children scratching a lot, and even waking up during the night because of the itches. Scratching causes tears of the inflammatorily changed skin, leading to additional inflammatory reactions. Eczema in adults affects mainly the forehead and eyelids, but also crooks of the arm, hollows of the knee and the backs of hands and feet. The skin becomes thicker and the lichenification is clearly visible.', 'The most important component of treatment is prevention. Breastfeeding (at least 6 months, no feeding of porridge before 4 months of age) can prevent the onset of infantile atopic dermatitis. If no breastfeeding is possible, the baby should be fed with hypoallergenic milk products (commercially available). Important is also a very good skin care with moisturizing creams and bath additives.

In case of strong bleeding or a suspected uterine rupture, an additional surgery may be necessary. The risks of a surgical abortion include the risks of all surgeries, such as infections, injury of nerves and vessels, and further injuries or weaknesses of the uterus that may cause complications for successive pregnancies. The psychological consequences should not be underestimated and treated as well. The patients should be supported for some time during their period of mourning. ', 'Generally, a pregnancy can be terminated medicinally or instrumentally/surgically, sometimes a combination of both treatments can be necessary. For a medicinal abortion, contractions-causing medication will be administered to drive out the fruit. Possible instrumental measures are suction-curettage, curettage or even the removal of the uterus.'),

To confirm the diagnosis, an ultrasound or MRI will usually be done. Conservative and operative treatments can be considered, depending on whether the tendon is ruptured completely or partially. If the ultrasound shows a partial rupture, a special shoe or plaster cast that stretches the foot may be sufficient. Is the tendon ruptured completely, it has to be surgically sutured and will be immobilized with a special shoe afterwards.'),

Either way, the skin gets tender and red after having touched something. An allergy or a damage of the protective layer of the skin can be the cause for it.', 'If the cause of dermatitis is an allergy, it means that the immune system assumed that the body was under attack after touching some foreign material and it releases a set of chemicals that causes the allergic reaction which results in an itchy rash called contact dermatitis. Common triggers for contact dermatitis include fragrances in cosmetics, perfumes, lotions, shampoos, soaps, citrus fruit, particularly the peel, latex rubber, chemicals used in tanning leather, nickel found in belt buckles and jewelry, hair dyes or straighteners, poison sumac, poison oak, and poison ivy as well as certain medicine applied on the skin. The skin of the affected person can form blisters or it can form a raised red area with rash. This means that the skin will itch and probably show a burning feeling. The affected person can immediately see the rash whenever something is damaging or irritating the skin. However the rash can take one to two days to appear if it\'s underlying cause is an allergy. Usually, symptoms of an allergic dermatitis show up exactly on the spot of the skin which was in contact with allergens (foreign substances) and is more itchy than painful. Dermatitis from skin damage tends to be more painful than itchy.', 'The affected person can treat the rash at home. As soon as the cause of the rush is identified (a foreign substance), it should not be touched again. A mild soap in combination with cold water should be used to wash the skin immediately if possible. This remove big parts of the substance and reduce the symptoms considerably. If the rash just appears on a small spot, hydrocortisone cream for relief can be used. The affected patient can apply moisturizers a multiple of times a day on the damaged skin to restore the protective layer. Also oral antihistamines can be used to relieve the itching. Unless a doctor suggests it, antihistamine lotion should be avoided since it can cause also an allergic reaction or skin irritation.'),

Once this pus drains away, a small channel is left behind.', 'The opening of the fistula is visible from the outside near the anus. Often it drains liquid, in case of bigger fistulas even stool. Caused by the drainage of liquids from the fistula, the surrounding skin is often reddened and itching. If the ostium is blocked, it can cause swelling and abscess formation with sharp pain.', 'Often the doctor can diagnose an anal fistula by visual inspection, palpation and probing. A rectum endoscopy is usually conducted for planning of further treatment. Surgery is then necessary to remove the whole fistula and to avoid possible complications.'),

For people suffering from this, it’s recommended that they maintain a low-fat diet, avoid eating meals late at night, quit smoking and using alcohol, and in the case of overweight patients a reduction in weight it recommended. Medications that reduce stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors, for example) have been shown to be effective, but they do not treat the cause of the reflux of acid.

Bladder cancer generally originates in the cells lining the bladder (ureothelial carcinoma, also called transitional cell carcinoma). It may have a single point of origin (unifocal), but usually there are several foci (multifocal). There are multiple degrees of severity of bladder cancer depending on how advanced tumor growth is, which structures in the bladder wall are affected, and even if other surrounding organs are affected. Treatment depends on the severity of the cancer.', 'Bladder cancer is when there is a growth of abnormal tissue, called tumor, that develops in the bladder lining. The most common symptom is blood in the urine which usually occurs painless. The tumor can spread, in some cases, into the surrounding muscles. Bladder cancer is a malignant cancer type. It affects older men three times more often than women.', 'Patients usually end up visiting a doctor when they notice blood in their urine (macrohematuria) without the presence of any pain. Besides blood in urine, other symptoms during urination can occur. Advanced stages may present with flank pains, which are due to the poor transportation of urine from the kidneys into the bladder. In about 20% of cases there are no symptoms accompanying bladder cancer. Routine urine analysis can find a microscopic amount of blood in the urine (microhematuria) and signs of white blood cells in the urine.', 'If the symptoms listed above appear, then an ultrasound should be done to eliminate the possibility of other diseases. Next, an endoscopy of the bladder is performed, which allows a view of the bladder’s surface. Abnormalities around the bladder can then be cleared or samples can be taken. Sometimes it’s possible to obtain cells to determine if the type of cancer. This is done with repeated flushing of the bladder via a urinary catheter. To determine whether it’s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in combination). The decision must be made on an individual basis for each patient. Discussing options with your doctor is highly recommended.'),

A family-induced weakness of the connective tissue can further cause the venous valves not to close properly. The resulting pressure increase in the veins leads to enlarged veins (sometimes visible as varicose veins) and further symptoms, which allow the condition to be separated in three stages.', 'Chronic venous insufficiency involves the failure of venal valves to close properly, so that the blood-flow, especially to the legs, is slowed down.

In stage two, the oedema are more or less strong, reddish-brown skin alterations appear along the lower leg, the skin becomes thin and a stasis dermatitis, a strongly itching skin inflammation caused by congestion, may occur. In stage three, all symptoms mentioned before can still be observed, and additionally the patients suffer from recurring wounds and ulcers that heal very slowly, especially above the inside of the ankle. Night cramps and a tingling sensation of the legs can occur at all stages.', 'Increasing ankle oedema and heavy, painful or even open legs lead the patient to see a doctor. Vessel sonography and an x-ray of the veins with contrast agents confirm the diagnosis; identify the affected parts and help planning the therapy. Conservative treatments include support stocking of compression class II, alternatively the legs can be wrapped with short-stretch bandages or a zinc paste bandage. Long standing and sitting should be avoided for the benefit of lying and walking. Kneipp applications (hot/cold sequence showers) support the venous blood return, as well as the activation of the muscle pump, the active ankle movement, whereby the lower leg muscles work and basically “squeeze out” the veins. If an ulcer already exists, it needs to be cleaned and the dead tissue needs to be removed, followed by a frequent and lengthy treatment with wound dressings and compressions. When the ulcer doesn’t heal or gets infected again and again, surgical measures may be considered. A surgical treatment of varicose veins can be an option as well, depending on the stage and the affected areas. Other options can be ligature of all affected veins in the groin (crossectomy), vein stripping, ligature of all connecting veins between superficial and deep venous system, sclerotherapy or laser therapy.

Epididymitis is a condition when there is an inflammation in the epididymis.', 'Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis. Males of any age can be affected. The causes can vary, but the most common cause is an infection. The treatment often includes medications such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers. Rest is advocated for relieving symptoms.', 'Epididymitis mainly results from bacterial infections. The bacteria may infect the epididymis through the urinary tracts such as the urethra, bladder, and even the prostate. Therefore, if people have infections of related areas, the risks of getting epididymitis will also be higher. However, sexual contact is the most common cause of infection. In elderly persons the underlying cause is often a bladder infection or an infection of the prostate, which expand on the epididymis. In younger man sexually transmitted inflectional diseases, such as chlamydial and gonococcal infections, are the main causes. Besides bacterial infections, epididymitis can also be caused by an injury of the groin, bladder emptying disorders, or use of amiodarone, which is a type of heart medication that may inflame the epididymis. People with epididymitis may have symptoms such as blood in the semen, discharge from the urethra, groin pain, lump sensitive to pressure next to the testicle, pain during ejaculation or urination, and painful scrotal swelling. Typically the pain develops slowly over hours or days and will not appear from one minute to another.', 'The treatments of epididymitis will depend on the causes. However, medications such as antibiotic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers can help to reduce the infection, inflammation and pain. In addition, people with an epididymitis are advised to have proper bed rest, elevation and ice packing of the affected area. This will help reducing pain.');

A seizure happens when the brain’s nerve cells fail to function correctly. Symptoms are stereotypic for each patient, depending on the area of the brain that the electrical discharge takes place. Generalized seizures (Grand Mal seizure, absence seizure) affect both hemispheres of the brain and are distinguished from focal seizures that only affect specific regions of the brain without the patient experiencing loss of consciousness.', 'Epilepsy is a chronic disorder and its characteristic is unprovoked, recurrent seizures. Many people with epilepsy have over one type of seizure and can have also other symptoms of neurological issues. The epileptic attacks are accompanied by a loss in consciousness, muscular convulsions, a change in muscle tone, and changes in perception.', 'Epilepsy occurs in 0.5% of the population. Seizures occur in different frequencies and at different intervals. Patients usually experience warning signs before a seizure such as nausea, feeling hot, or unusual and indescribable feelings. Sleep deprivation and alcohol withdrawal as well as hard breathing can trigger a seizure. A Grand Mal seizure is the most common form of epilepsy and presents as loss of consciousness, falling, muscle cramps, and muscle convulsions. After several minutes, a period of confusion and drowsiness follows until the patient regains normal awareness. The patient cannot remember the event. During the seizure the patient may bite their tongue, urinate, or defecate. In contrast, an absence seizure presents as an acute disruption in awareness without a deeper loss of consciousness and usually occurs in children and youth. It can manifest as discreet signs such as blinking, slight twitching, or absent-mindedness. Absence seizures usually occur several times a day and can be triggered by quick breathing. Simple focal seizures involve muscle twitching that it limited to a specific area or sensations on the skin. Acoustic and visual sensitivity can also be symptoms of epilepsy. Patients often remain conscious. Complex focal seizures involve déjà vu phenomena, feeling of insubstantiality, hallucinations or even heart-racing and difficulty in breathing. The patient’s gaze becomes rigid, the patients perform chew- and lick-movements and produce retching sounds.', 'If the patient can’t recover between two seizures, they can develop a so-called Status epilepticus. This is dangerous, because the disrupted breathing can cause an undersupply of the vital organs as well as the brain. Antiepileptic medication is used for therapy. Patients should avoid provocation factors such as excessive consumption of alcohol. After two years without any seizure, the medication may be discontinued.'),

Other medical conditions such as (a) venal issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and dyslipidemia, (b) an issue with the nerves such as paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, dementia, epilepsy, or (c) hormonal imbalances such as low testosterone or hyperprolactinaemia may be responsible for erectile dysfunction. Psychological issues such as fear of failing to perform sexually, depression, stressful experiences, and dysfunctional partner relationships can lead to erectile dysfunction. Additionally, it’s possible that nerves responsible for having an erection could have been damaged during a prostate operation or there could be side effects from medication.', 'Erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection during sex in over three fourths of all attempts in a time period of 6 months or longer despite sexual arousal.', 'Erectile dysfunction affects about 5% of men in their 40s, 15% of those in their 60s, and 50% over 70.

It is a very dangerous condition for a pregnant woman. This kind of pregnancy usually cannot continue to birth. It is strongly recommended to remove the embryo to prevent severe damage to the mother.', 'As mentioned, a normal egg cell will be fertilized in the oviduct and then travel from oviduct to the uterus, and implant inside the wall of uterus. However, there are several conditions that can cause the fertilized egg to implant somewhere else but not within the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy happens mostly in the oviduct. Ovary, cervix and abdominal cavity are other places where an ectopic pregnancy may occur. The most common cause is an obstruction (stenosis) of an oviduct, which can prevent the fertilized egg from entering the uterus. Such obstructions occur due to scar formation, typically after infections of the female reproductive system (adnexitis), but also after surgery and after a previous ectopic pregnancy in the oviduct. Another well-known cause is endometriosis, which can increase risks for ectopic pregnancy and other difficulties in pregnancy. The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can be abnormal vaginal bleeding, low back pain, mild cramping on one side of the pelvis and pain in the lower pelvic area. Often this condition will lead to an inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis) and its typical abdominal pain, which exacerbates on mild pressure of the abdomen and on physical activity. A regular pregnancy test will also be positive in case of an extrauterine pregnancy.', 'An ectopic pregnancy is very dangerous for a pregnant woman. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth. The treatment of ectopic pregnancy includes surgery and medications that end the pregnancy. For the common case of the ectopic pregnancy being located in the oviduct, the tube will bloat due to fetal growth, it will cause severe pain and may rupture.

People with osteoarthritis in the finger joints near to the nails of their fingers are most likely to develop the condition close to those joints. People who have injured their tendons or joints in the past have also a higher risk of developing ganglion cysts. A ganglion cyst is usually painless. The pain can occur when a cyst presses on a nerve but even small cysts can cause muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, or pain. Large ganglion cysts form noticeable lumps. Most people consult a doctor because of motion restriction and cosmetic issues.', 'Since ganglion cysts are often painless, there is no need for treatment. Doctors can recommend a watch-and wait-strategy. In case of pain or interference with joint motion, the doctor can recommend immobilization since activity can cause the cyst to grow larger.

Other causes may comprise arthritis, other syndromes or illnesses such as Marfan syndrome and cerebral palsy. Inappropriate shoes that do not fit correctly can contribute to the occurrence of the condition since tight shoes may rub against the big toe joint and high-heeled shows may squeeze the feet, causing the big toe to be stuck in a leaned position. Such position keeps the big toe stretched. The nerve around the big toe will be pressured, triggering pain. In addition, high heels push most of the body weight forward onto the front part of the foot, which puts significant strain on the joints of the toe. The main symptom of the condition is the big toe directing in the way of the other toes present on the same foot. This may lead to the foot bone linked to the big toe to point outwards. Secondary symptoms may comprise sore skin above the upper part of the hallux valgus, red, callused and hard skin generated by the overlapping of the great toe and the following toe, swelling and pain over the joint of the great toe. Changes to the form of the foot may make it hard to find appropriate shoes and wearing shoes may then trigger a pressure that makes the pain worse. In addition the affected person may also experience a bony, swollen lump on the external brink of the foot.', 'Treatment depends on the patient’s age, medical history and activity, as well as the damage to the metatarsophalangeal joint.

Risks are: Sunburns in the childhood and youth, immunosuppression, genetic factors (white race, albinism, xeroderma pigmentosum and affected family member) and dysplastic nevi (=abnormal dark birthmarks). There are several types of melanoma: 1) Superficial spreading melanoma: the melanoma has flat but irregular shapes and different colors. 2) Nodular melanoma: the melanoma is not flat but raised. The raised areas are normally black and dark blue or red. This form is especially malignant because it tends to spread into the depth of the skin, which makes metastases more likely. 3) Lentigo maligna melanoma: the melanoma rises on base of a lentigo maligna. This skin alteration often appears due to over-exposure to sunlight, especially on the face, neck and arms. 4) Acral lentiginous melanoma: the melanoma often appears on nails, palms, soles and mucosa. 5.) Amelanotic melanoma: a nodular melanoma without dark pigmentation. Possible indications of melanoma based on the acronym ABCDE include 1) Asymmetry: it often is unevenly shaped, 2) Borders: the edges are irregular, 3) Color: the melanoma has different colors (very dark and brighter areas in the same lesion), 4) Diameter: the melanoma is usually larger than 5mm in diameter, 5) Evolution: it may change in appearance, either in size or color.', 'The treatment of melanoma is to surgically remove the affected areas including a safety distance. Additional chemotherapy can kill the cancer cells to prevent the cancer from returning. Immunotherapy with medications like interleukin or interferon can be used to strengthen the immune system to fight against the cancer. Radiation therapy can be used if a patient cannot get surgery for reasons like bad general condition or a concomitant disease. If there is any suspicious symptom of melanoma, it is recommended that you consult a dermatologist for early intervention because the risk for metastases is directly depending on the depth of the melanoma.'),

For children between 1 and 3 years of age, a squint is actually a dangerous condition. In this timeframe the visual area matures and a squint could lead to an irreversible and lifelong suppression of one eye (amblyopia).', 'The treatment of a squint can include: 1) Contact lenses and eyeglasses: it can help to adjust the vision for people with near- and farsightedness. 2) Prism lenses: it can adjust the angle of light entering the eyes and enables binocular vision despite squint. 3) Eye muscle surgery: it can correct the position or length of the eye muscles. 4) Covering the healthy eye of a child. This will force the brain to use the squinting eye and therefore prevent loss of eyesight (amblyopia).'),

The most common cause is iodine deficiency, but certain diseases and inflammations can also cause goitre.', 'An enlarged thyroid gland is called goitre. People with a goitre may have a swollen neck and sometimes even difficulty in breathing and swallowing. Iodine deficiency used to be the classic cause of a goiter in the past. The causes of a goitre are various, so the treatment will depend on the specific disease.', 'The causes of a goitre are various. However, the deficiency of iodine used to be the most common reason. Nowadays in many countries there is a tiny amount of iodine supplemented in the table salt in order to prevent this problem. Besides that, there are many other factors that can cause a goitre. For example, an immune disease such as Grave’s disease or Hashimoto’s disease can affect the gland and result in a goitre. Abnormal nodules on the gland may also affect the normal function of thyroid gland and eventually lead to a goitre. Thyroid cancer and inflammation are also factors that irritate the gland and make it enlarged. People with a goitre may present with a swollen neck and sometimes also have difficulties in eating and breathing.', 'Since the causes of a goitre are various, the treatment will depend on the underlying disease. Generally speaking, to relieve the symptoms of a goitre, the treatment will include medications to adjust the level of thyroid hormone. In some cases radioactive iodine will be used to decrease the size of the thyroid gland. In other cases, especially with a malignant tumor a surgery will be necessary to remove the gland. For prevention of a goitre a supplement of iodine is advised.'),

There are a variety of reasons for bowel incontinence.', 'Bowel incontinence can occur at any age; however it is most common at old age. The causes are various. Conditions of the brain (stroke, multiple sclerosis, dementia, tumor) or the spine (paraplegia) can lead to bowel incontinence, as well as illnesses directly affecting the intestines (diarrhoea, obstipation, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, and hemorrhoids, weakness of the pelvic floor, abscesses, fistulas, and surgeries). Another group of conditions that can cause bowel incontinence are psychological disorders (psychoses, addictions). Side effects of medication are not to be neglected and should be examined in the event of initial bowel incontinence. Many patients suffer badly from bowel incontinence. Many of them don’t go out in public anymore because of unpleasant sounds or odours, and plunge into severe depression.', 'Initial bowel incontinence should be comprehensively examined by a doctor to determine its causes. Possible measures include examination of the anal region, probing of the rectum, stool tests, ultrasound, colonoscopy or even a computer tomography or magnetic resonance tomography. Not all measures are necessary to identify the causes. Treatment depends on the causes. If a causal treatment is not possible, the patient should be advised as good as possible on dealing with bowel incontinence and on existing aids, to allow a greatly unrestricted life with the condition. Patients should consult a doctor frequently to diagnose complications such as depression or infections of the skin of the genital area early and treat them accordingly.'),

However, it may lead to massive loss of blood, which makes medical treatment necessary.', 'Epistaxis‘ main symptom is nosebleed. Its severity can vary, depending on the bleeding’s source. Bleedings from the nasal atrium are usually slight and will stop by itself, bleedings from nose parts further behind can be very strong. Sometimes the nose might not even be the source of the bleeding; the blood may come from the oesophagus (bleeding oesophageal varices) or from a basal skull fracture. If the patient loses a lot of blood, he may feel dizzy or even faint, and there is always the risk that blood may reach the lungs (aspiration). Swallowed blood can cause nausea and diarrhoea.', 'It’s recommended that patients sit down, bowing their head forward, so that the blood can flow out of the nose and not into stomach or lungs. Cooling the neck and pressing the nostrils together can stop bleedings from the front part of the nose; however, it won’t work for bleedings from the back of the nose. If the bleeding doesn’t stop, or if other symptoms such as dizziness or fainting occur, a doctor should be consulted immediately. Even if the patient has an existing blood clotting disorder or takes blood-thinning medication, a visit to the doctor could be necessary to treat the source of bleeding adequately.

('c__403', 'A trigger finger results from an inflammation happening in the sheath surrounding the tendon ant the tendon of a finger itself. The inflammation will cause the affected finger to be stuck in a position because the tendon is unable to pass through its sheath (the annular ligament mostly builds the obstacle). This causes the finger to stay in its bent position until the pulling force is strong enough to tug the tendon through the obstacle. Thereby results the typically flipping straightening motion.', 'A trigger finger is a condition which occurs when the affected finger has a restraint in straightening. The finger stays bent at the beginning of straightening and then suddenly straightens with a flipping movement. The movements are like pulling and releasing a trigger. Anti-inflammatory drugs are frequently used to treat the condition. A surgery will be necessary if the treatment does not work.', 'The cause of a trigger finger is mainly an inflammation. Once an inflammation occurs in the tendon of a finger, it may cause swelling and the related stiffness. As a result, the affected finger will become locked and bent for a while, and then it may suddenly straighten with a snap. The movements are like pulling and releasing a trigger. And a trigger finger often happens to the thumb, middle finger and ring finger but every finger can be affected. If the condition is severe, then the affected finger may even stay in the bent position and be unable to straighten ever again. The risks of getting a trigger finger are related to the working environment, lifestyle and any other diseases. For example, people who need to repeat actions like clicking, gripping and typing during work are more likely to have the problem. Besides, diseases such as arthritis and diabetes can also increase the risk. People with a trigger finger may experience symptoms not only such as a finger stuck like pulling a trigger, but they may also feel nodules, tenderness, stiffness and pain at the affected area.', 'The treatment of a trigger finger is to reduce the inflammation and swelling. Treatments often include medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs can help to relieve the inflammation as well as the pain. If the treatment does not work, a local injection with steroid or a surgery will be necessary. The goal of surgery is to remove the bottleneck (mostly through a cut of the A1 annular ligament) so the tendon is able to slide smoothly again.');

Bladder incontinence in women can result from birth giving, a weak pelvic floor, prolapse of the uterus, prolapse of the bladder or low estrogen levels. In men it can be caused by enlargement of the prostate or narrowing of the urethra. Other possible causes include an infection, inherited deformity or neurological disease of the bladder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, paraplegia, an operation, or medication. There is also stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence (which comprises 70% of all cases), in which urine involuntarily passes when there is an increase in pressure on the abdomen, for example during coughing or when lifting heavy objects. Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.', 'Involuntary urination or urinary incontinence occurs when a person is unable to hold intentionally urine in the bladder and decide when he should empty the bladder.

First of all, if the sore is smaller than one centimeter, then it is called minor aphthous stomatitis. Second, if the sore is bigger than one centimeter, then it is called major aphthous stomatitis. The major type also includes more than one lesion at the time, longer duration than 10 days and eventually even scars after healing. Third, if the sores are extremely small but somehow they merge together, then it is called herpetiform aphthous stomatitis, this name is due to its similar look to a herpes simplex virus infection. People with aphthous stomatitis will feel pain or tingling inside their mouth, which may cause a difficulty to speak normally or to eat. The affected person may feel a tingling or burning sensation in an inflammed area right before the appearance of the ulcer. In order to form fully, an ulcer takes 2 to 3 days.

Chronic pericarditis causes less severe symptoms as an acute pericarditis.', 'The symptoms described above in addition to characteristic diagnostics from physical examinations as well as changes to inflammation markers of the blood and in most cases also changes of the ECG lead the doctor to his diagnosis. He will also perform an ultrasound examination of the heart to rule out that liquids accumulate inside the pericardium. The first step of therapy is physical rest. All other measures depend on the cause of the pericarditis. Antibiotics for pericarditis caused by bacteria, cortisone or other anti-inflammatory medication for viral or unknown causes are only a few possible treatment options. The prognosis of pericarditis also depends on the cause. Most cases of pericarditis will heal; others develop into a chronic form. Sometimes a re-occurrence of pericarditis is possible.'),

But in most cases the cause is unknown.', 'Hiccups are a reflexive contraction of the diaphragm, causing a fitful inhalation of air. The inhaling process is stopped by a quick closure of the vocal folds, so that the typical “hic” can be heard. It can be caused by an irritation of the diaphragm because of extreme stomach filling, cold, gassy drinks, consumption of alcohol or inflammable irritations.', 'With repeated reflexive inhaling, talking becomes difficult. Long-term forms can cause various complications such as sleeping disorders, hypoxia and depressions. The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than 48 hours include swallowing air with sucking on candy or chewing gum, sudden changes of temperature, emotional stress or excitement as well as eating and drinking too much alcohol or carbonated beverages. Hiccups that last over 48 hours can be triggered by different factors including irritation or nerve damage, central nervous system disorders such as tumors, traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, meningitis and encephalitis. Drugs and medical disorders such as tranquilizers, steroids, kidney failure, electrolyte imbalance, diabetes, barbiturates, anesthesia, and alcoholism can cause also long-term hiccups. The only sign is the characteristic sound of a hiccup. Sometimes, the only symptom is a little tightening feeling in the throat, chest or abdomen that precedes the sound.', 'Because the cause is unknown in most cases, usually only the symptoms of hiccups can be treated, if necessary. Treatment can include a variety of home remedies, such as holding breath for a long time or exhaling into a paper bag. A variety of medication can be taken for chronic hiccups, but which one leads to the desired success has to be identified by trial-and-error. If the cause is known (e.g. heartburn), it can be treated (e.g. gastric acid blockers). Once the heartburn subsides, the hiccups will subside as well. Hiccups are generally harmless, but can be burdensome for the patient.'),

Viral Infections are the most common cause of croup. Since there is no causal therapy against these viral infections and croup brings symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing and noisy breathing, steam therapy and decongestant medication are often used as symptomatic treatment.', 'The causes of croup are various, including infections by viruses or bacteria, irritations of the airway, allergy and acid reflux. The most common cause is viral infection. In times before vaccinations the main cause of croup was diphtheria. Nowadays viruses such as influenza and parainfluenza, rhino- and adenovirus, measles and chickenpox commonly cause an infection and inflammation of all airways, and therefore may also lead to croup. People with viral caused croup may first have symptoms similar to a simple cold, and gradually feel a difficulty in breathing, start coughing and may have noisy breathing and hoarseness. Besides an infection, also irritation of the airways, allergy and acid reflux can result in spasmodic croup. Probably due to intraday variation of cortical levels, croup is normally worse during the night, especially on the first two days after onset. In severe cases a coup can lead to a life threatening shortness of breath and will therefore need immediate intensive care.', 'The treatment of croup will depend on its cause. However, due to the common symptoms such as swelling of the airway and difficulty in breathing that croup brings with it, steam therapy is often used to improve symptoms. Medications such as epinephrine or corticosteroids can be used to reduce the swelling in case of emergency. However, if the croup is spasmodic, then medication to improve the underlying problem, such as allergy or acid reflux, may be used.'),

It can be classified as allergic or non-allergic. Medications such as decongestant nasal sprays, corticosteroids and antihistamines can help to relieve the symptoms.', 'Rhinitis can be classified into allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis: In this case, the body’s own immune system will build antibodies against certain substances (allergens) that are normally harmless. On contact with the allergen the immune system then starts to release histamine, which will lead to a process of inflammation and the typical symptoms. Examples of allergic rhinitis include: 1) Seasonal allergic rhinitis, which often results from pollen of trees and herbs that are spread in the air when the plant is blooming. This form of rhinitis is also known as hay fever. 2) Perennial allergic rhinitis, which often results from mold, dust mites and dander of animals. The common symptoms include itching in the nose, sneezing, stuffy and runny nose. Because the allergic reaction mostly also affects the conjunctivae, red and tearing eyes with dark circles around are a common symptom in allergic rhinitis. Non-allergic rhinitis: the causes of non-allergic rhinitis are various. Viral infections, such as the flu or a cold, are common reasons. It can also be triggered by smoke, heavy odors, medications, nutrition factors (alcohol, spices), physical activity and changes in the temperature or humidity during changes of season. This kind of rhinitis often leads to runny nose and nasal congestion without affection of the eyes.', 'The treatment of rhinitis may include medication to reduce the symptoms, such as nasal-decongestion sprays, oral or nasal antihistamines and corticosteroids.

It usually takes some weeks to heal. It is recommended to follow the principles of RICE (rest, icing, compression and elevation) when strain of the neck muscle happens and to avoid overusing the affected muscles. Medications like painkiller can also relieve the symptoms.', 'Strain of the neck muscles can be caused by: 1) Improper postures, such as being hunched over to read or to use a computer, 2) Improper position during sleep, such as sleeping on a pillow that is too high or too hard. In this situation, the neck has to stretch and maintain the same posture, and strain may happen. 3) Carrying or lifting heavy things on the shoulders, which can cause overstretch of the neck muscles. 4) Traumas and injuries, which can damage or over-stretch the neck muscles, such as a fall from a height, sport accident or a car accident. Due to the initial damage on the muscles, nerve fibers are irritated and via a reflex arc this leads to a further increased contraction of the muscle. This circuit is the reason why a strain of the neck muscles takes a longer time to heal than the often little damage would let expect.', 'Once the strain happens to the neck muscles, it is recommended to follow the principles of RICE, which means to rest, to ice, to compress and to elevate. Meanwhile, pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication, muscle relaxants can also help to relieve the symptoms and give a breakthrough in the vicious circle. Massage can help the blood flow to the neck muscle and loosen the tight muscles. Heat therapy can also achieve this purpose. Immediately after damaging the muscles it is recommended to cool the area to prevent inflammation. Afterwards warming is advantageous to increase blood flow and thereby accelerate healing. It may take a few weeks for the neck muscle to recover. During this time it is better to avoid too intensive activities, which lead to pain.'),

People with the problem should visit a doctor either for medications to relieve the symptoms or surgery to improve the condition.', 'Causes of cervical spinal stenosis include the following reasons: 1) Aging: As people get older, the aging process can cause a bulging of the discs, or a thickening of ligaments (ligamentum flavum). Aging can also lead to destruction of cartilage that cover bones and to excessive growth of the bones in joints. These conditions can narrow the spinal canal and cause spinal stenosis. 2) Inherited conditions: some people are born with a narrowed spinal canal. People with cervical spinal stenosis may have symptoms as pain, numbness and stiffness or weakness in the neck, shoulder, arms, hands or legs. Typically there is only one body side affected.

The underlying cause of portal hypertension, and therefore of esophageal varices, are mostly liver-related problems, for example, more than forty percent of people with esophageal varices have liver cirrhosis. Liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, infection of the liver and fatty liver can all end into cirrhosis. In addition, thrombosis of the portal vein is also a common reason. Thrombosis of the portal vein is a condition when there is a blood clot stuck in the portal vein and it thereby causes high pressure in the vein which then leads to esophageal varices. Generally speaking, all persons with hypertension of the portal vein, disregarded which cause it has, are at a high risk of getting the disease. People with esophageal varices mostly have mild symptoms such as abdominal pain or dysphagia. Guiding findings are other stigmas of portal hypertension such as ascites, specific skin marks and an enlargement of the spleen. A rupture of an esophageal varices will result in massive inner bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract. This may lead to blood vomiting and problems with circulation that have high mortality.', 'The therapy of esophageal varices contains the treatment of the underlying cause, mostly the treatment of portal hypertension with medications or an artificial shunt (TIPS). In order to prevent rupture of the veins and the related fatal complications, the varices may be treated endoscopically by band ligation or sclerotherapy. If the varices rupture and start bleeding, an immediate intensive care and endoscopic intervention, in order to stop the bleeding, will be needed.'),
('c__478', 'Difficult dentition is the difficult or delayed process of growing teeth. There are two periods for the growth of teeth. The first period is the growth of milk teeth which usually occurs between 6 to 30 months of age. The second period is the growth of permanent teeth which usually occurs from 6 to 14 years of age. When the teeth do not grow on time, then it may be considered as difficult dentition.', 'Difficult dentition is a delayed process of growing teeth. The causes of difficult dentition include genetic predisposition, nutrition and underlying diseases. Normal dentition happens at the age of 6-30 months and then a second time between the ages of 6-14 years. It is recommended to consult a doctor when difficult dentition occurs. ', 'The causes of difficult dentition may include several factors: 1) Genetic predisposition: genes determine when teeth start to grow. If there is a defect in the gene, then it may lead to delayed growth of teeth. 2) Nutrition: Nutrition plays an important role to support proper and healthy growth of teeth. 3) Illness: some diseases such as dysfunction of the thyroid or pituitary gland may affect the growth of teeth.', 'Sufficient nutrition and balanced diet help children to have healthy growth of teeth. Parents should always pay attention to their children’s nutritional status and have them regularly checked up by their pediatrician. If difficult dentition happens we recommend that you consult a pediatrician or a dentist to check for underlying diseases.'),
('c__479', 'A jaw fracture is the condition of broken bones in the lower jaw (mandible, mandibular bones) or in the upper jaw (maxilla, facial bones). The fracture of the mandible is among the most common fractures because the anatomic location of the mandible is prominent and for this reason can be hit first. Various blunt shocks to the jaw such as direct assault used to be frequent causes of a mandibular fracture before common usage of automobiles. Nowadays, automobile accidents are often the cause of a mandibular fracture. Most of the time, just the nose is damaged. A mandibular fracture is a frequent facial injury resulting from a direct blow to the jaw. This fracture means that the joint that connects the jaw to the skull is dislocated. Sometimes, the jawbone is not fractured but symptoms may appear similar to the fracture of the jawbone. ', 'A jaw fracture is the condition of broken bones in mandibular bones or facial bones (maxilla). It often requires immediate medical treatment. To determine if surgery is necessary a doctor will detect the location of the jaw fracture by x-ray or computed tomography. Meanwhile, treatment will include medications to relieve pain and swelling and antibiotics.', 'The causes of a jaw fracture are mostly accidents such as car or motorcycle accidents, falling from a height or being attacked by people or injured by certain objects. A jaw fracture can happen either to the lower jaw (mandible, mandibular bones) or the upper jaw (maxilla, facial bones). When a person has a jaw fracture, pain on the face, numbness of the lips, difficulty in opening or closing the mouth, swelling and bruise in the affected areas is experienced. Often the teeth don’t fit together perfectly.', 'The treatment for a jaw fracture may be conservative or operative. If the jaw fracture is mild, then rest and avoiding using the injured part is important. This often includes a liquid diet. Medications such as pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics may also be used to reduce the symptoms and prevent an infection. Sometimes it may be necessary to temporarily fix the upper and lower jaw together with a splint until the fracture has healed. For severe cases, surgery is necessary to realign and repair the broken areas with metal plates and screws.'),
('c__48', 'Anorexia, also called anorexia nervosa, is a psychological disease in which affected persons suffer from a disturbed body perception. This causes them to feel much too overweight and unattractive and to suffer from it. They will then try to counter this perception with various measures. Those can range from strict monitoring of food intake to a complete refusal to eat. People who are affected by anorexia avoid eating sufficient quantities of food and attempt to speed up their loss of weight by vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive athletic activity. The reason for this is their warped perception of their figure. As a result of these actions, the body weight is reduced to a body mass index value under 17.5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the body’s weight (in kilograms, Kg) with the square of the body’s height (in meters). The BMI for a person of normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to people with anorexia, people with only bulimia (see the article on bulimia) have a BMI value over 17.5.', 'People with anorexia suffer from a misperception of their own body. These are mainly young women. Even though they are much too thin, they perceive themselves as “too fat” and unattractive. Anorexia is characterized by a severe restriction of nutrition and an intentionally induced underweight state with the patients trying to lose even more weight.', 'Women are affected most often, but not exclusively. As mentioned above, patients’ symptomatology or behaviour often begins with monitoring their food intake with calorie charts. This is then often followed by measures to significantly reduce weight, including excessive exercise, vomiting, laxatives, but also consumption of appetite suppressants as well as foregoing many foods. Affected persons do not like to eat in company anymore and will take a very long time to eat even smallest amounts of food.', 'The insufficient supply with calories, but more importantly with vitamins and other essential nutrition can cause serious or even life-threatening physical symptoms. A low body weight can lead to hormonal disorders, such as irregularity or absence of menstruation. Men with anorexia may experience loss of potency and sexual drive. When the body fails to receive sufficient nutrition, bones can no longer rebuild themselves, which can lead to the early development of chronic osteoporosis. In rare cases it can lead to a reduced heart rate and body temperature, which requires an urgent trip to the hospital. Treatment of anorexia requires a specialist and is extremely important, as undernourishment can be fatal under certain circumstances. Treatment often occurs over a long period of time and relapse is common. In the event of acute life-threatening weight loss, induced nutrition, e.g. via a gastric tube or high-calorie drinks will be the initial treatment, followed by intensive psychotherapy and nutritional counselling.'),

Sometimes when people are unconscious, vomit, blood, or some fluid can also block the throat. Such an accident can happen to people at any age; however, children have a higher risk of being affected due to their curiosity. A foreign body in the throat can cause: 1) Damage to the throat: if there is a foreign body stuck in the throat, it may damage the mucous membrane of the throat due to sharp edges or pressure. As a result, it may cause symptoms such as bleeding, pain, fierce coughing, and difficulty in swallowing, breathing and talking. 2) Obstruction of the airway: when there is a foreign body stuck in the throat, it can cause an obstruction of the airway. People then may respond with coughing and difficulty in breathing. Furthermore, if the foreign body cannot be removed, it may lead to loss of consciousness or apnea.', 'The treatment of a foreign body stuck in the throat is mainly to remove the lodged object as soon as possible. The Heimlich maneuver is the first aid needed in such a situation. The applied pressure on the abdomen will increase the air pressure in the lungs and airways, which hopefully will clear the airways. Also the mouth and throat should be checked for an object that may be able to be removed manually. If it is too difficult to force the foreign body out, then it is strongly recommended to seek prompt medical help. In severe cases, surgery to remove the stuck object is necessary.'),

The symptoms of a metabolic encephalopathy start normally acute, and the damage can be temporary or permanent. The treatment involves urgent measures and the therapy of the underlying illness causing the metabolic disorder.', 'A metabolic encephalopathy happens when the normal function of the brain is disturbed by an abnormal concentration of metabolites. A metabolic disorder leads to such abnormal levels of metabolites and therefore may result in some damages of brain cells, which then lead to a loss of their function. A metabolic encephalopathy can result from metabolic diseases such as imbalance of electrolytes (blood salts), hypothyroidism or other dysfunction of endocrine system, the end stage of kidney failure, severe liver diseases (cirrhosis) and many other diseases that can disrupt the normal metabolism. Besides, abuse of drugs and medications, or the toxicity of heavy metal can also result in an abnormal metabolism and lead to a brain dysfunction. The symptoms of a metabolic encephalopathy mostly occur acutely. People normally suffer from symptoms of impairment of consciousness like concentration disorders, delirium and loss of consciousness. However, this disease is reversible and curable as long as the treatment is early enough. If the damage cannot be repaired in time, then it may become a permanent damage and lead to a further diseases like dementia.', 'The treatment of a metabolic encephalopathy will depend on the underlying problems. For example, if it is caused by an end stage of kidney failure, then the acute and long term treatment will be a regular hemodialysis.

However, surgery is necessary in severe cases.', 'The causes of a disease of the heart valve can be either congenital or acquired. Congenital diseases of the heart valves often occur in the pulmonary valve and aortic valve, and acquired diseases of the heart valves often involve the aortic valve and mitral valve. Generally speaking, there are three common types of dysfunction of a heart valve: regurgitation, atresia and stenosis. Regurgitation occurs when the valves are unable to close adequately, and this leads to a flowing back of blood on every heartbeat. Stenosis means that the valves do not open regularly and therefore narrow the blood canal. This occurs when the valves thicken and become stiffer. Atresia means, that the channel where the valves are located is abnormally narrow and prevents blood flowing through. An often found hint for a disease of the heart valve is a heart murmur (heart sound). Depending on which valves are affected, patients may develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations or swollen legs.', 'The symptoms of some heart valve diseases develop slowly and are minor at the beginning. Sometimes they do not need any treatment but controls at regular intervals.

People with the problem should consult a doctor either for medication to relieve the symptoms or surgery to improve the condition.', 'A spinal stenosis is the result of several degenerative processes. The promoting factors are: 1.) Aging: Due to yearlong strain of the spine, the spinal disk loose volume and tend to build protrusions. Meanwhile the vertebral bodies tend to ossifications in form of bone spurs, so called spondylophytes, which also may narrow the spinal canal. 2.) Arthritis: chronic arthritis may cause spinal stenosis, such as spinal osteoarthritis (spondylarthropathy) and rheumatic arthritis. 3.) Spondylolisthesis: A condition with forward gliding of a vertebral body caused by spondylolysis. 4.) Inherited conditions: some people are born with a small spinal canal or a curved spine. 5.)

Normally some women with primary dysmenorrhea may feel pain before menstruation starts, and the pain may become worse when the level of prostaglandin further increases during menstruation. 2) Secondary dysmenorrhea: This type of dysmenorrhea firstly appears anytime in life. There are mostly underlying disorders of the female reproductive system such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids or a myoma that cause menstrual pain. The pain caused by secondary dysmenorrhea is usually also worst during menstruation but it will not necessarily improve after the period of menstruation. Instead, the pain may appear later in the cycle and become worse instead of getting better. Therefore, the pain can last much longer than a normal period of menstruation. A secondary dysmenorrhea should always be checked by a gynecologist.', 'Treatments of dysmenorrhea are mainly aimed at relieving the pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can lower the level of prostaglandin and therefore reduce the pain. Hormone medications such as estrogen and progesterone, which are used to prevent pregnancy, can also be effective in reducing dysmenorrhea. Sometimes changes of lifestyle can also help, for example, getting enough rest and sleep.

These affected organs include uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. The disease can lead to infertility. Therefore an immediate medical treatment is necessary. Antibiotic is often used for it. ', 'The causes of pelvic inflammation are various. However, most commonly it is resulting from sexually transmitted diseases, for example gonorrhea and chlamydia. Women may probably be at a high risk of getting a pelvic inflammation when their sex partners have a sexual transmitted disease or when they have several sex partners. Besides sexually transmitted diseases, an improper douche may also cause a pelvic inflammation. An improper douche can change the vaginal environment and specific pathogenic bacteria may be flushed into female reproductive organs which lead to a pelvic inflammation. Women with a pelvic inflammation may experience fever, discharge from vagina, bleeding, pain around the pelvis, feeling of nausea and vomiting. Worst of all, it can also result in ectopic pregnancy and even infertility.', 'The treatments of a pelvic inflammation include antibiotics. First of all, the doctor may try to find out the specific species of pathogenic bacterium, and then decide which kind of antibiotics to use. Meanwhile, the antibiotics can be given through oral intake, injection or vein. Hospitalization may be suggested for some cases with severe pelvic inflammation.'),

Chronic pancreatic inflammation, cystic fibrosis or tumors may be factors also resulting in damaged pancreatic tissue. People with pancreas insufficiency may experience poor digestion, fatty or foul-smelling stools and weight loss. Destruction of pancreatic tissue may also lead to insufficient insulin production and therefore cause diabetes, which is named endocrine pancreas insufficiency.', 'The treatment for pancreas insufficiency consists of pancreatic enzyme replacement to support the digestion of food, medications to reduce the level of blood fat and avoiding alcohol consumption.

An immediate stationary treatment in the hospital is necessary.', 'There are two main types of peritonitis: 1) Primary spontaneous peritonitis: it is an infection that starts in the peritoneum. The highest risk for it is water in the abdomen (ascites), which often develops in advanced liver diseases. 2) Secondary peritonitis: it develops when, due to an injury or infection in any abdominal organ, bacteria reach the abdominal cavity. The common risks include trauma to the abdomen and abdominal surgery. A very common cause of peritonitis is an appendicitis. A peritonitis is always a life-threatening condition. With peritonitis symptoms like fever, chills, excessive fatigue, less urination, nausea and vomiting, rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath may appear. Because the peritoneum is very sensitive, patients suffer from debilitating abdominal pain, which only remits in rest with cocked legs.', 'Treatment will depend on what is the cause of the specific peritonitis. The cause must be identified promptly. It is recommended to immediately start to treat the infection with intravenous antibiotics.

Familiar tremor is usually a dominant trait, if one of the parents carries the gene, then the son or daughter has a higher risk to have the tremor. However, affected parents are no necessity to suffer from an essential tremor. People with familial tremors may have trouble holding things. Emotional stress can increase the tremors as well. The specific symptoms include head nodding, shaking or quivering sound, problems with writing, drawing and drinking. It may occur when the person moves, which is called motion-related tremor, or when the persons gets older. In rest symptoms are slight. Sometimes it gets worse with stress and caffeine. Alcohol consumption typically lowers symptoms.', 'Familial tremor normally does not need to be treated. Some medicine may help to relieve the symptoms such as propranolol (a beta blocker) and primidone (a drug to treat seizure). They are the cornerstones of medical therapy for familial tremor.

It can cause acute but also chronic inflammation and result in anal abscess or fistula. A suspected inflammation of the anal glands should be consulted with a doctor.', 'Cause of anal gland inflammation is an infection by bacteria in a deep wrinkle of the anal mucosa (crypt), in which the anal glands lead. The infection is mainly caused by fecal residues, which always contain lots of bacteria. Common symptoms include redness, tenderness, fever and pain of the infected area. Enlarged mucosal wrinkles (papillae) are possible, too. Papillae may become larger than normal and make patients feel anal discomfort, itching, burning and sometime pain at bowel movement. Furthermore, if the infection is not controlled and progresses, anal abscesses or fistula can appear later.', 'The treatment could be either conservative therapy or surgical treatment. Conservative therapy includes: 1) daily sitz-bath with nitrate solution to keep the infected area clean, 2) external medication like suppositories and balms.

Furthermore, fever, chills, fatigue and general weakness may happen, too. Over time an anal abscess can also result in a fistula, which will form a canal from the infected cavity (abscess) to the surface of the skin.', 'The treatment of an anal abscess is mainly to remove the pus out of the infected area. A surgical drainage is often performed to drain the pus out from the affected anal gland. Also the whole cavity should be removed, because otherwise the recurrence of an abscess is very likely. Meanwhile, medications such as antibiotics may be used to prevent further infections. Hospitalization is often recommended for a detailed examination.'),
('c__52', 'Celiac disease or sensitivity to gluten is a chronic disease of the small intestine. It affects each person differently. Symptoms can occur in the digestive system or in other areas of the body. A person affected by a sensitivity to gluten will have a reaction in his small intestine which is triggered by his immune system, whenever he eats gluten. This reaction, over time, damages the lining in his small intestine, which prevents the absorption of certain nutrients. This malabsorption can lead to serious complications and can affect development and growth in children.', 'Celiac disease, sometimes called coeliac or sprue, is an immune disease that affects the small intestine. It is caused by a gluten intolerance. The small intestine becomes damaged due to a sensitivity against anything that contains gluten. Gluten is a component of cereals (wheat, barley, rye).', 'Women are more likely to be affected by this disease. The cause of celiac disease lies in an intolerance to gluten, which is found in types of grain (especially wheat, barley, and rye). Children who have the disease can suffer from growth disorders, weight loss, and diarrhea. Adolescents and adults show symptoms like a persistent fatigue, weakness, and diarrhea after consuming gluten products. Celiac disease is rarely associated with blisters caused by dermatitis herpetiformis.', 'The only treatment for celiac disease is a diet that removes the grains mentioned above. Such a diet allows the small intestine to repair itself. Left untreated, celiac disease can allow deficiencies to develop, such as anemia (see the article on anemia) or osteoporosis (see the article on osteoporosis). Untreated there is also a higher risk for developing intestinal cancer.'),
('c__520', 'The burning muscle pain occurring several hours after heavy muscle work is considered as muscle soreness. Nowadays it is supposed that these pains develop due to small injuries in the muscle fibrils, the contracting elements of a muscle cell.', 'Muscle soreness describes pain in the muscles that appears several hours after intense muscle work and lasts for few days. The reason for this is most likely the appearance of small injuries (micro traumata) in the motoric structures of the muscle fibers during overstressing. The relieving factors for muscle soreness include medication, mild massages and local warming.', 'On the cause of muscle soreness is not yet fully agreed. The theory of accumulation of lactic acid being responsible for pain seems disproven since the amount of pain does not correlate with the amount of lactic acid. Furthermore, at the time the pain occurs, the accumulated lactic acid is already degraded for the most part. More probable seems that small injuries (micro traumata) in the z-line of the muscular fibrils are responsible for muscle soreness. Due to these injuries the muscle cells start to swell and to build inflammatory substances. Because there are no nerve endings in a muscle fiber, the injury cannot be felt at the time of their incidence. But now, when the swelling goes back and the inflammatory substances are flushed out, the nerves get in contact with these substances and start to signalize pain. This happens about 12-24 hours after overstressing.', 'The relieving factors for muscle soreness are mainly medications, physical therapies and heat application. Medications such as painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve the discomforts that muscle soreness brings. Physical therapies, such as mild massages of affected muscles, and heat application, such as warm packing or a warm bath, will stimulate the blood circulation and therefore accelerate the process of healing.'),

The low concentration of hypocretin is thought to be associated with a loss of brain cells that produce hypocretin due to some autoimmune reactions. Whether other factors such as vaccinations, a trauma or injury to the brain, tumors in the brain, stress, an irregular sleep schedule, and abuse of medications or any other damage to the brain can result in narcolepsy, is not finally proven. The common symptoms include extreme daytime sleepiness (sleep attacks despite sufficient amount of sleep), cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone while retaining consciousness, triggered by a emotional stimulus such as joy or fright), hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations directly after awakening), as well as sleep paralysis (inability to move directly after awakening while fully conscious).', 'Lifestyle changes, called sleep hygiene, can help to reduce the symptoms of narcolepsy, for example: 1) a regular sleep schedule, 2) keeping the bedroom dark during sleep, 3) avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, 4) not smoking, 5) doing something relaxing to fall asleep before bedtime, 6) regular exercise. Individually assessed strategies like daily sleeping episodes or the avoidance of certain situations will help to handle the disease. In addition, medications might be used for the treatment of narcolepsy, for example, 1) stimulant medicines, such as methylphenidate or modafenil, can help to stay awake during the day, 2) antidepressant medicines can help to reduce cataplexy, sleep paralysis and even hallucinations, 3) sodium oxybate can also help to control day time sleepiness and cataplexy.

Without treatment, ptosis can cause amblyopia, particularly if the dropping lid enough to reduce or block the vision.', 'Congenital ptosis refers to a drooping upper eyelid which is present from infancy. If the condition is severe, a drooping eyelid may affect normal vision. When an infant is born with congenital ptosis, a doctor will evaluate if any treatment is necessary. If vision is not impaired and the eye can still be closed no therapy is needed.', 'The cause of congenital ptosis is mainly due to the abnormal development of a levator muscle. The levator muscle helps to raise the upper eyelid and open the eye. Most of the time, congenital ptosis only happens to one eye. People with congenital ptosis may not fully open the affected eye and may have impaired vision.', 'A ptosis is usually mild and vision will not be impaired which means no treatment will be required. However, it is recommended to have surgery early in order to correct the condition if it is serious and impairs the vision. It is better to have the procedure performed when the infant is not less than three years old as the eyelid is then a little bigger. This makes it easier to work with it. In case of a severe droop which blocks the vision, a surgery can be required urgently for the baby to allow him to have a regular vision.

Damage of 3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve): An often and serious cause is an aneurysm in an artery supplying the brain. It can also be caused by brain disorders, such as a head injury, a hemorrhage, a tumor, diabetes or high blood pressure. It leads to an outward squint, a hanging eye lid (ptosis) and wide pupil with reduced response to light. 2.) Damage of 4th cranial nerve (trochlear nerve): It is most often caused by a head injury. Other causes are diabetes, tumor, aneurysm, and multiple sclerosis. It will affect normal vertical eye movements and lead to double vision. Affected patients tend to tilt their head to the healthy side in order to compensate for the paralysis and to prevent this double vision. 3.) Damage of 6th cranial nerve (abducens nerve): It is the most common one. It can be caused by head injuries, high brain pressure, tumor, multiple sclerosis, aneurysm, brain or eye infections, bleeding within the brain, vasculitis and hypertension.

For example, car accidents, falls or being attacked by a fist or weapon can result in rib fractures due to the trauma happening to the chest. Besides, illnesses such as osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism or bone metastases can weaken the bone structure and therefore increase the risks of getting rib fractures. Such weakened ribs can even break due to coughing. Rib fractures can be classified as single, multiple or comminuted fracture. People with a rib fracture may feel pain around the chest; furthermore, the pain typically worsens when people take a deep breath, touch the affected area or move their body. Besides, crepitation of the rib can sometimes be triggered by movements or pressure. In some cases the broken rib pierces into the chest and may lead to a hemato- or pneumothorax, or even damage the lungs or the heart.', 'The treatment of a rib fracture includes mainly medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, painkillers, and narcotics to relieve the symptoms.

But acquired causes like rheumatic fever, endocarditis, degenerative aortic valve diseases (aortic sclerosis), trauma and surgery are the most common causes of valvular dysfunctions and aortic regurgitation. 2) Aorta abnormalities: expansion of the aorta may also lead to an insufficient closure of the aortic valves and cause reverse blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle. Therefore an aortic sclerosis, connective tissue diseases such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a dissection of the aorta may also result in aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can occur either acute or chronic. Acute aortic regurgitation can manifest with the sudden appearance of significant symptoms such as pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock and heart failure. Chronic aortic regurgitation normally happens gradually and can lead to an enlargement of the heart and end in a heart failure. The symptoms of chronic aortic regurgitation are gradually increasing shortness of breath, palpitations, pressure on the chest and loss of physical resilience.', 'Minor asymptomatic forms do not need any treatment but a regular check-up. Treatments of aortic regurgitation include: 1) medication: vasodilators (ACE-inhibitors) can help to improve the ejection fraction of the heart, lower the aortic pressure and reduce reverse blood flow.

The esophagus is made of smooth muscles, which transport the food with peristaltic waves, and an upper and lower sphincter, which close the end of the esophagus if necessary. A dysfunction of the esophagus results from either abnormal muscular contractions of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal function of the upper or lower sphincter.', 'A dysfunction of the esophagus describes several conditions in which the esophagus cannot function normally. For example, gastroesophageal reflux is one of the common results of a dysfunction of the esophagus. It is recommended to visit a gastroenterologist for a further check if there are any related symptoms.', 'The causes of a dysfunction of the esophagus could either be an abnormal contraction of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal functioning of the upper or lower sphincter. 1) Dysfunction of the upper parts of the esophagus often results from an excessive muscular contraction of the esophagus (esophagus spasm), which leads to difficulty in swallowing and drinking. Typical symptoms of esophageal spasm are globus sensation in the throat, pain in the chest and regurgitation of food. 2) Dysfunctions of the lower esophagus can result from either a high or a low muscular contraction of the esophagus and its lower sphincter. If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too strong, while the peristaltic smooth muscle waves are too weak, it will prevent the food from passing into the stomach, so it gets stuck in the esophagus (achalasia). Typical symptoms are problems with swallowing, pain in the chest and upper abdomen and regurgitation of food. 3.) If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too weak, it may lead to a flow back of acidic gastric contents into the esophagus, which causes damage on the esophageal mucosa. This is a common problem that is referred to as gastroesophageal reflux. People with gastroesophageal reflux may have symptoms like heartburn, chest pain, painful swallowing or coughing at night. The typical symptom of heartburn means a painful burning sensation in the upper abdomen or the chest, which worsens after eating and at night while lying horizontally.', 'The treatments of a dysfunction of esophagus include medications and rarely a surgery. The treatment will depend on the specific problem. For example, medication such as calcium channel blockers can help to relax the muscles of the esophagus when the dysfunction is caused by intense muscular contractions.

Besides chronic high alcohol intake can lead to permanent brain damage. 2) heart: arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, stroke and high blood pressure, 3) liver: fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, 4) pancreas: alcohol can make the pancreas produce toxic substances that lead to pancreatitis, 5) cancer: it can increase the risks of mouth, esophagus, liver, throat and breast cancers, 6) immune system: drinking too much can also weaken the human immune system. Symptoms of intoxication with alcohol and consequences of drinking too much include: 1) reduced inhibition and aggression, 2) slurred speech, 3) motor impairment, 4) confusion, 5) memory and concentration problems, 6) coma, 7) breathing problems, and even 8) death. Alcohol addiction is not defined by an amount of alcohol consumed but by psychic symptoms such as craving, loss of control of the amount consumed, withdrawal symptoms and social consequences.', 'An acute intoxication with alcohol may be life threatening and, in case of complete loss of consciousness, needs immediate intensive care in order to maintain vital functions such as breathing and circulation. Intoxicated persons should be put in a recovery position to protect them from aspiration of vomit. One of the most well-known treatments for alcohol use disorder is to join the mutual support group Alcoholics Anonymous. Besides, there are plenty of other possibilities like support with medication and behavioral therapies, as well as combinations of treatments.'),

Patients with physical traumas suffer from pain or loss of function (e.g. they can\'t move their leg after a fracture). Large or strongly bleeding wounds, or injuries of the inner organs can even lead to volume deficiency shock. Mental traumas can cause various symptoms as well, from total apathy to shock and hyperactivity.', 'Consequences and treatment depend on the type of injury. Talk therapy or short- or long-term medication help in the event of mental traumas. Sometimes an in-patient therapy in a specialized clinic might be necessary. A complication of a mental trauma is the post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment for physical traumas also depends on the injury. Simple fractures or wounds can be stitched or rested in a plaster cast, while complicated or shifted fractures as well as contaminated, large wounds may require surgery. The more severe the injury or the more injuries a patient has, the more comprehensive is the treatment. Polytraumatized patients often need intensive care with ventilation or multiple surgeries.'),

It will not only damage the surface, but break through the enamel and the dentin and reach the nerve of a tooth. The treatment includes fillings, crowns, root canal therapy and the removal of the decayed tooth. It is recommended to visit a dentist if dental caries is present in order to prevent further damage.', 'The cause of dental caries is mainly plaque. Plaque is a biofilm made up of saliva, food, bacteria and acid. It can adhere to the inside of the mouth, especially the teeth, and damage the surface of the teeth, which is called enamel. Plaque often starts to accumulate in the mouth after eating. Some of the bacteria living in plaque are able to destroy enamel. These bacteria get promoted by the presence of sugar. Once the enamel is damaged, holes begin to form on the surface of the tooth and the bacteria spread deeper into the tooth. People with dental caries may have symptoms such as bad breath, toothache, holes on the tooth, pain while chewing, and tooth sensitivity. Furthermore, it may lead to an inflammation, an infection or even an abscess of the tooth.', 'It is important to practice good oral hygiene in order to avoid dental caries. Here are some guidelines that can help to prevent dental caries. For example, to brush teeth with fluoride toothpastes, clean teeth after eating, avoid consumption of sugar containing snacks and drinks, and visit a dentist regularly. However, the treatment of dental caries includes 1) fillings (for mild dental caries), 2) crowns (for dental caries that have weakened the structure of a tooth), 3) root canal therapy (for dental caries that have affected the nerve of a tooth) and 4) the removal of a tooth (for a seriously damaged tooth).'),

This leads to the bones becoming fragile, so that they break easier or spontaneously. Frequent fractures of e.g. vertebral bodies, thigh- or forearm bones can occur.', 'Osteoporosis mainly affects elderly persons and, within this group, mainly women. Most common reason is a vitamin D deficiency; in women it is mainly hormonal changes after the menopause that causes calcium and phosphate to dissolve from the bone. The bone mass decreases, the bones are not as robust anymore and typical fractures and related pain occur. Spontaneous fractures (without any hit- or push-impact) most commonly occur in the vertebrae, but also in the pelvis or the forearm. Low bone-stability leads to frequent typical fractures that can occur either spontaneously or following slight traumata.', 'Blood tests and bone density measurements with certain x-rays can help the doctor to diagnose osteoporosis. Besides tending to existing fractures, treatment will depend on the identified causes. A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D as well as regular exercise are very important in the prevention and reduction of bone loss. Foods that are high in calcium include dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese), dried figs, almonds, sesame seeds, cod liver oil, salmon, and chicken eggs. Because vitamin D is produced predominantly after sun exposure in the skin and is not easily absorbed from digested foods, it’s recommended that people from 65 years onwards use calcium and vitamin D dietary supplements to prevent osteoporosis. If the presence of osteoporosis is confirmed in a bone density test (a densitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DXA), treatment with calcium and vitamin D should be started immediately. Additionally, a class of medications called bisphosphonates may be used to stop further bone loss. Often intake of vitamin D and calcium can be sufficient, but sometimes more comprehensive measures may be necessary.'),

A dilative cardiomyopathy (“sacculation“ and enlargement of the heart, so that lesser amounts of blood are being pumped into the body circulation) occurs due to genetic factors, as part of circulatory disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease) and heart attack, following virus infections. Patients suffer from breathlessness, cardiac arrhythmia and general symptoms such as weakness and fatigue. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leads to a thickening musculature mainly of the left heart, without gaining any strength. On the contrary, muscle strength rather decreases! The result is a decrease in the amount of blood being pumped into the body circulation, due to the reduced muscle strength (non-obstructive type) or due to movements/tightening of the blood’s path (obstructive type). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also shows symptoms such as breathlessness under strain, cardiac arrhythmia and the general symptoms mentioned above. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very stiff. It can’t be filled with the sufficient amount of blood anymore, and the blood accumulates in front of the heart. This also leads to breathlessness, but also to an enlarged liver and spleen and may cause dysfunctions. Patients also suffer from swollen and heavy legs. The fourth type is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. When suffering from this type, heart muscle tissue is being more and more replaced by fatty and connective tissue. This tissue is less durable and tends to sag out, similar to the dilative cardiomyopathy. Fatty and connective tissue also doesn’t have the functions of muscle tissue and can’t contract to pump blood into the circulation. Patients suffer from short periods of unconsciousness, irregular heartbeat and heart palpitations. The fifth type is non-classifiable cardiomyopathies. All types can lead to sudden cardiac death.', 'Some examinations are required to identify the type of cardiomyopathy. The symptoms provide a first idea. One of the first measures is usually an ECG and the analysis thereof, followed by chest x-rays as well as a heart ultrasound. The blood parameters will be determined, and a catheter examination of the heart or a sample taking may be considered as well. Therapy and prognosis depend on the identified type of cardiomyopathy. All measures include omission of substances or habits that can damage the heart (alcohol, smoking, certain medication), as well as rest. Cardiac insufficiency will be treated as well, but with different approaches. Additional specific measures are necessary for the respective types. This may include therapy of the underlying cause, pacemaker implantation, surgeries or even a heart transplant. The doctor will discuss the individual therapy with the patient. All cardiomyopathies are serious conditions that can strongly impair the patients’ daily activities and require intensive therapy, depending on the stage of severity.

In fact, the condition is so common in childhood that most of adult persons are immune to it because they have had it before. With some children there are only some spots but with others it can be possible to see their entire body covered with spots. The common areas affected include the legs and arms, the belly and chest, beneath the arms, scalp and ears, and on the face. Children catch usually chickenpox in spring and winter, between March and May.', 'Chickenpox is an infection caused by a varicella-zoster virus that is highly contagious. Most cases are in children below the age of 15. It spreads very easily from one person to another. The typical symptom of chicken pox is an itchy, uncomfortable rash. In adults the virus can become active again and lead to shingles.', 'The highly contagious disease occurs primarily in children and can be seen as a skin rash over the entire body, with small, reddish, and itchy blisters. The risk of infection starts 1 to 2 days in advance to the appearance of blisters until the decrease of crusted wounds (usually 5 to 6 days after the rash has started). After the illness has run its course, the virus continues to reside within the body (inside certain nerve cells) and can become activated again later in life or in individuals with compromised immune systems. This infection is called shingles or herpes zoster and appears as a localized, very painful skin rash. The disease is contagious in people who have not yet had the varicella virus. In older people, pain may continue for several weeks or even months after the rash has disappeared. The disease usually runs its course without complications or consequences. Patients with pre-existing conditions such as neurodermatitis or weak immune systems may have a worse experience. Newborn babies are also greatly at risk of an infection. Chickenpox is considered a moderate disease when it occurs in children, but the affected skin areas can be extremely itchy and the child can have multiple symptoms ranging from fever, to feeling irritable even to feeling miserable.', 'Chickenpox doesn\'t have a particular treatment however medication can improve the symptoms. Mostly what happens is that the affected children\'s blisters start to crust up and then fall off by themselves within a timeframe of up to two weeks. A kid who has the disease should be kept away from public places so that the risk is reduced of infecting other persons who may not have had it. It’s also recommended that contact with pregnant women should be avoided, as an infection early on in the pregnancy or towards the birth can put the baby into serious health risks. Normally the treatment for chichenpox consists of medicine which reduces the urge to itch. Salves can also be used to dry out the blisters. With herpes zoster, anti-viral medication can be used to shorten the duration and intensity of the disease. A vaccine exists for children and youth against varicella and there is also a zoster vaccination for seniors over 60.'),

HSV-2 is responsible generally for outbreaks of genital herpes. The genital form affects the anal area, buttocks and the genitals. This form is considered as a sexually transmitted illness. There are other forms of herpes that can attack the skin, eyes or other areas of the body. Newborn babies and people with fragile immune system can suffer a lot from the virus of herpes simplex. ', 'Cold sores (fiever blisters) and genital herpes are diseases caused by herpes simplex viruses, however by two different viruses in the herpes simplex group. They appear as painful groupings of blisters on the lips and genital areas. Transmission happens through direct contact (kissing, sexual intercourse).', 'Infection results from direct contact, such as touching, kissing, and sexual intercourse. The disease appears as a painful grouping of blisters on the lips, in the mouth, or in the case of genital herpes, on the genitals and is very infectious. Over 95% of people are carriers of herpes simplex virus type 1 (cold sores), but only 20% have type 2 (genital herpes). Once infected, herpes simplex virus type 1 remains in the body and can cause new cold sores during periods of fever, stress, infection, exposure to the sun, injury, or during menstruation.', 'The disease usually is autolimited without serious harm, but for people with weakened immune systems it can lead to complications. Contact with someone during their pregnancy requires caution, as a herpes infection during pregnancy can have serious consequences for the child. Treatment is usually local and involves the use of creams with antiviral ingredients. To prevent the spread of the disease, abstain from kissing and sexual intercourse during an outbreak of cold sores or genital herpes.'),

Noroviruses often cause vomiting and diarrhea for 2-3 days, are very infectious, and can cause an epidemic.', 'Stomach flu or viral gastroenteritis is an infection that occurs in the intestines and is transmitted often by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food. The virus is transmitted also through physical contact with a person who is infected by the virus. A healthy person can recover easily without complications but people with weak immune systems, older adults, and infants can die from the infection. Prevention is vital since no treatment is effective.', 'Between a few hours and a few days after contagion, the patient experiences vomiting or diarrhea. Some pathogens may cause blood in the stool. It is usually accompanied by loss of appetite, fatigue, stomach pain or -cramps. Fever and sweating can occur as well. Many patients describe vertigo and a tendency to collapse, which can be caused mainly by dehydration.', 'Patients can find themselves in a dangerous situation if they become too dehydrated from the loss of fluids due to diarrhea and vomiting. Thus it’s important to replace lost fluids by rehydrating often (with drinks like cola that contain sugars and salts). Bed rest is also recommended, as well as easily digested foods (toast, pretzel sticks), and medication for nausea and diarrhea can be used if needed. If diarrhea does not go away, a high fever develops, there is blood in the stool, or you cannot drink without help, make an appointment with your doctor.'),

Arteries are blood vessels that transport oxygen and important nutrients from the heart to other parts of the body. The hardening of these arteries restricts sometimes blood to flow to the tissues and organs. The plaques in the walls of arteries can burst, causing a blood clot. Even if atherosclerosis, which is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, is understood often as a heart condition, it can happen in arteries located in other parts of the body. The condition is treatable and can be preventable.', 'Arteriosclerosis, also called atherosclerosis, is a systemic disease of the arterial blood vessels that leads to a hardening of the arteries caused by an accumulation of blood lipids, blood clots (thrombi), connective tissue, and sometimes local inflammation forming plaques (lime) along the walls inside the vessels.', 'Arteriosclerosis and the illnesses that result from it are the most common cause of death in industrial countries. Risks for developing arteriosclerosis include: high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking, increase in blood lipids (especially cholesterol), diabetes, being overweight, a diet rich in calories and fats, lack of exercise, and stress. Men and the elderly are more likely to be affected and it tends to run in families. The disease may not show any symptoms at first, until signs such as circulation disorders, blood clots, heart attacks, stroke, or sudden death occur.', 'Diseases that result from arteriosclerosis include coronary artery disease with accompanying chest pain (angina pectoris), heart attack, stroke, and smoker’s leg (see the corresponding articles).

Risks for coronary artery disease and the same as those for arteriosclerosis: high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking, increased blood lipid levels (especially cholesterol), age, heart attacks (in related family members), diabetes, being overweight, a diet rich in calories and fats, lack of exercise, and high levels of stress. Decreased blood supply to the heart muscles leads to symptoms typical of angina pectoris with feelings of tightness in the chest and a pressure on the chest that radiates out to the throat or the left arm. Symptoms may feel similar to those of heartburn. Symptoms usually manifest during periods of effort, psychological stress, or in cold conditions and disappear within 15 minutes.', 'If a plaque built up in a vessel detaches, the coronary artery is then closed and cause a heart attack, which is the dying off of part of the heart’s own muscles caused by lack of blood. Symptoms typically include intense, long-lasting angina pectoris that does not improve, accompanied by nausea, cold sweats, and shortness of breath. In the worst case, a heart attack can lead to death, so if the above mentioned symptoms occur it is an emergency situation and a hospital visit is necessary. In order to prevent coronary artery disease, it’s important to get regular daily exercise, eat a Mediterranean-style diet (little fat, lots of vegetables, fish, and fiber), avoiding nicotine (quitting is best), and keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood lipid levels in check. To clarify the causes for angina pectoris, you should visit a specialist in cardiology. Treatment depends on the severity of the disease (see the article on heart attacks).'),

Triggers for a heart attack include vigorous physical effort, stressful situations and significant fluctuations in blood pressure.', 'If a heart attack is identified too late, the coronary muscle turns to scar tissue and can lead to heart failure, arrhythmia, or pulmonary edema (water in the lung). A visit to the hospital is a must for anyone experiencing the symptoms named above. If it’s treated soon enough, part of the heart muscle and the life of the patient can often be saved. A small procedure to install a thin stent into the coronary artery can help to keep the clogged artery open and reestablish blood flow. Stent or no, medications need to be taken throughout the rest of the individual’s life to prevent a second episode. Medications may include aspirin, cholesterol lowering drugs, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors.'),

Any vein in the body may become varicose, but the condition develops commonly in the feet and legs, especially in the calves. That is because standing upright and walking increases the pressure in the veins of the lower body parts. Varicose veins can lead sometimes to serious problems.', 'Varicose veins are enlarged and swollen veins, usually dark purple or blue in color, which occur usually in the legs. They may be also twisted, bulging or lumpy in appearance. This disease can give an indication towards a higher risk for circulatory problems.', 'Varicose veins affect roughly 15% of the population and women aged 30 and above are especially affected. Patients usually notice their legs swelling in the evenings and sensations of tiredness, heaviness, or tension in their legs. Walking and lying down alleviate symptoms, whereas standing and sitting aggravate them.', 'Superficial varicose veins can be treated with compression stockings or by a low-risk surgery. If varicose veins remain untreated over a long period of time, it can result in chronic venous insufficiency, whereby the valves in the deep veins fail to close properly. Chronic venous insufficiency causes permanent swelling (edema), a hyperpigmented and itchy rash, a blue-ish coloration of the skin, and in the worst case, injuries that fail to heal (leg ulcers). It’s important to seek out treatment for these problems early and consider some small procedures.'),

It is potentially dangerous, as the clot can cause swelling and pain in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism when it travels from the leg’s deep vein into the right atrium of the heart and then into the lungs, where it becomes lodged in the increasingly smaller blood vessels.', 'Deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot in a deep vein in the legs, which could potentially reach the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.', 'Anyone can develop deep vein thrombosis but it becomes more common over the age of 40. The causes of deep vein thrombosis are many: being inactive for long periods such as during a long journey, after an operation or during a pregnancy, clotting disorders, varicose veins, being heavily overweight, estrogen (birth control pills), and smoking. In some cases, there may be no typical symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. If symptoms do occur, patients often notice a pain similar to that of sore muscles in the affected leg (usually your calf), sensations of tension or weight, swelling, a warm sensation in the region of the clot and pain when pressed, and red skin, particularly under the knee at the back of your leg. Deep vein thrombosis affects usually one leg, although not always. The pain may be worse when patients move the bodyweight from their foot upward towards their knee.', 'If symptoms present themselves after a long flight for example, a doctor or hospital should be sought out immediately. There you can be fitted with compression stockings to wear every day. These stockings will help prevent complications and improve your symptoms. The doctor may also prescribe blood thinners to prevent further clotting and to decrease the risk of a pulmonary embolism considerably.

The most common form of anemia comes from a lack of iron in the blood.', 'The most common cause of anemia in Central Europe is iron deficiency. It overwhelmingly affects women of childbearing age, as loss of iron occurs during menstruation or the intestines fail to absorb enough of it. Men can also have an iron deficiency and upon further investigation it is usually discovered that there is an issue of iron absorption or bleeding somewhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Besides an iron deficiency, a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folic acid can also be a cause of anemia. Genetic diseases that can cause anemia, such as thalassemia are rare. Signs of anemia include weakness and tendency to become tired easily (especially during physical exertion), pallor of mucous linings as well as sometimes grooves in the fingernails, loss of hair, headaches, and dry skin.', 'Very often, iron deficiency is not identified until visiting a doctor. Taking iron tablets and changing a diet (such as including more red meat) is the usual practice for treating anemia.

Even if hyperventilation syndrome can appear very similar to panic attacks, the two conditions are different. Usually, hyperventilation syndrome develops in context of stress, anxiety, excitement, or panic.', 'Hyperventilation, called sometimes overbreathing, is breathing in excess of what the body needs. Sometimes, deep or rapid breathing is seen in very serious conditions such as heart attack, bleeding, or infection.', 'Women in their 20s and 30s are affected the most. During a hyperventilation attack, the patient develops feelings of narrowness in the chest, sharp chest pain and shortness of breath despite increased breathing. Additionally, sensory disorders can be noticed, like “pins and needles”, reduction of sense of touch. Hands can cramp up in a so-called “obstetrician’s hand”. Shaking, headache, dizziness, and palpitations can also occur. In rare cases, hyperventilation syndrome has a physical cause, but it is usually caused by psychological conditions.', 'During a hyperventilation attack, the patient should be calmed down and made to breathe into a bag. After an accurate diagnostic of the condition, the doctor will arrange, if the syndrome is not really serious, follow-up care with a primary care doctor or a psychiatrist who will teach the patient about the condition and techniques to help control the attacks. Breathing exercises and psychosomatic therapy can help to identify an attack early on and to stop it with measured breathing. Sometimes, certain medicine can be prescribed after a follow-up care.

It’s possible to get some vitamin D through dietary supplements, such as cod liver, salmon, chicken eggs, and beef liver, but the amount of vitamin that these sources provide is not sufficient.', 'Vitamin D deficiency is a regular condition. Vitamin D plays vital roles for numerous functions within the body including reducing inflammation, promoting cell and bone growth, keeping normal levels of phosphate and calcium, and promoting the absorption of calcium. For these reasons a lack of Vitamin D can commonly lead to osteomalacia in adults or rickets in children.', 'Numerous factors can lead to lack of vitamin D. A firm vegan regime for a long period can deprive the body from the sufficient amount of vitamin D since animals are the natural providers of this vitamin. A limited exposure to the light from sun can also lead to vitamin D deficiency since the body produces vitamin D when the skin is exposed to its light. A limited exposure to the light from the sun can happen when a person puts on long dresses or covers themselves for religious motives, or have activities that keep them away from the sun. People with dark skin are also at risk of vitamin D deficiency since the ability of the skin to produce Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight is reduced by the pigment melanin. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused also by the inability of the kidney to convert this vitamin to its active type. This can happen in case of disease or ageing process. This deficiency can also be caused by the inability of the digestive tract to absorb adequately vitamin D. This can be the result of some medical issues such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and cystic disease that affect the ability of the intestine to absorb the vitamin from the food eaten. Obesity can also cause vitamin D deficiency as fat cells extract the vitamin from the blood, fluctuating its discharge into the circulation. Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency include muscle weakness and bone pain. However, many people have subtle symptoms. Yet, deficiency of vitamin D can expose the body to health risks such as cardiovascular disease, severe asthma, cancer, and cognitive impairment. A vitamin D deficiency in children can lead to rickets, a condition in which bone development is arrested. Adults can suffer from osteomalacia. ', 'Because the population is chronically deficient in vitamin D, it’s recommended nowadays that all people older than 60 take vitamin D with calcium as food supplements. It has been shown that muscle power increases based on that and that the bone loss (osteoporosis) can be positively influenced as well as the frequency of falls can be reduced. As the diseases related to a deficiency of vitamin D can be critical it is important for a potentially affected person to find a suitable therapy with help of a medical doctor in order to reach the necessary level.'),

These calories are burnt off through physical activity and the body stores the excess energy as fat. The condition is an increasingly common issue since many people living in modern societies eat excessive quantities of high-calorie, cheap food while spending a lot of time sitting in cars, on couches or at desk. Some underlying health conditions can contribute also to weight gain, as an example hypothyroidism. However these conditions usually do not cause problems if they are controlled effectively with medication. Some of the signs of obesity include a higher than normal waist circumference and body mass index, having additional fat around the waist, clothes are feeling tight and the person needs a larger size of clothes. In addition, the scale shows that the person has gained weight. In some cases, metabolic syndrome may occur simultaneously. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by having dyslipidemia, high blood pressure and diabetes, all three together.', 'Obesity is a risk for the development of additional medical conditions, most importantly, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease and stroke, deep vein thrombosis, sleeping disorders (sleep apnea syndrome), gallstones, and arthrosis. It’s important for the affected individual to acknowledge the significance of their obesity and cooperate enthusiastically with their treatment. Treatment usually consists of a long-term change in diet that includes a reduction in calorie intake, regular physical activity, and behavioral group therapy. Certain medications can also be prescribed to aid weight loss. The goal of therapy is not to lose weight quickly, but slowly and permanently.

Enlargement of the prostate makes urination difficult, causes the urine to flow back along the urinary tract, and may also cause bladder or kidney infections.', 'BPH causes the urinary tract to become narrowed and this can cause urine to flow backwards. People with BPH notice that it takes longer to urinate, the stream of urine is weaker, and when urination has finished, they still feel that the bladder has not been completely emptied and drops of urine continue to drip. Additionally, an urge to urinate frequently develops and intensifies during the night. Depending on the growth of BPH, the sex life of the person with it may be negatively affected and have an influence in the patient’s quality of life. Retention of urine often causes infections of the bladder and the kidneys. If you notice these symptoms, consult a specialist (urologist) immediately.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia needs to be differentiated from malignant prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common form of malignant cancer in men. It affects preferencially the dorsal prostate region and can be partly felt with the finger (digital-rectal examination) from the rectum.
