  "descriptionShort": "Flu (often referred as influenza), is a viral infection of the nose, sinuses, throat, and respiratory tract by an influenza or parainfluenza virus. Swine flu and bird (avian) flu are specific strains of flu.",
  "medicalCondition": "When the infection occurs in healthy young people, it is usually not dangerous and lasts around one or two weeks. In some cases a dry cough may develop and last a bit longer. Elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses have a higher risk for complications. For this reason it’s recommended that these groups get vaccinated. Swine and bird flus are caused by slight different influenza viruses, but causing similar symptoms. Flu typically develops rapidly, with fever (sometimes accompanied with chills), muscle pain, headache, a dry and painful cough, sore throat, and exhaustion or fatigue. It’s important to note that the flu is different from the common cold, which is often also caused by a virus, but causes milder symptoms.",
  "treatment": "Even today flu can have fatal consequences for those with pre-existing conditions and requires a hospital stay with emergency medical measures. Normally it is self-limited and the body recovers by itself. A doctor may prescribe medication to help shorten the course of the flu if taken early. Bed rest and staying hydrated are usually sufficient. Medications such as Ibuprofen or Aspirin can lower a fever and relieve symptoms, but they will not shorten the course of the illness and should be used in children with caution. Flu vaccine is recommended for the following groups at risk: nursing infants, people over 60, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women.",

  "descriptionShort": "An allergy is an undesired reaction to a substance which under normal circumstances do not cause any reaction in healthy people. Many substances can cause an allergy, e.g. pollen from trees and grasses, animal hair, dust mites, food, medications, and certain skin products.",
  "medicalCondition": "Allergies against pollen from trees and grasses are commonly known as hay fever. It can manifest in the form of inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), hay fever (rhinitis), and/or asthma and usually occurs in spring and summer. Dust mites and animal hair can also trigger allergies, which can also be identified through inflammation of the mucus membrane under the eyelid (conjunctivitis), chronic nasal discomfort (rhinitis), and/or asthma. These often manifest themselves throughout the year. Certain foods can also trigger allergic reactions, which can lead to either very mild symptoms (for example, a prickling sensation in the mouth and throat areas after enjoying certain fruits) or to life threatening reactions throughout the body. These need to be distinguished from intolerance reactions. Medications are yet another group of substances which can trigger allergies, usually involving the skin, but which can also affect internal organs. So­called contact allergies are a group of skin diseases that result from skin contact with a substance and trigger an inflammatory reaction called eczema. People with a higher inherited (genetic) predisposition to development allergies against pollen, animal hair, or food are called atopic.",
  "treatment": "In rare cases, an allergic reaction can become life threatening. In such a case, the patient must have an emergency kit at their disposal that he can use himself (see the article on food allergies). The treatment of allergies consists, when possible, of the avoidance of the substance that causes them. When the substance cannot be avoided, medical alleviation of the ailments becomes necessary, for example, with antihistamines. In certain cases a specific kind of immunotherapy, also called desensitization, is indicated.",

According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, a blood pressure that is less than 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) is normal. This means that a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg (a millimeter of mercury, the unit of measurement for pressure) or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg is considered high and should be treated. The systolic pressure corresponds to the maximum pressure in the larger arteries and is generated during contraction and ejection stages of the cardiac cycle (called the atrial systole). Diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure in the arteries and happens during the relaxation and filling stages of the cardiac cycle (known as atrial diastole), and is a measurement for the constant load on the vessel walls.",

The treatment of diabetes is carried out through regularly checking blood sugar levels and through medication. When it comes to medication, either insulin shots are administered or in the case of Type-2 diabetes it may be enough to take medications that strengthen the effect of insulin or insulin production.

  "medicalCondition": "Acne can be identified by the presence of various skin changes, such as comedones (also called blackheads), skin nodules (also called papula), pustules, and lumps. Acne often occurs during puberty due to hormonal influences and is more frequent with boys. Moreover it is associated with a higher familial incidence. Despite popular beliefs, acne is not a problem of bad hygiene.",
  "treatment": "Certain forms of acne can leave unsightly scars behind, which may impact the patient. Early treatment can prevent or partly alleviate this issue. Treatment aims to clear the ducts of sebaceous glands, reduce the production of sebum, and to relieve inflammation from abnormalities in the skin by fighting certain bacteria of the skin. Treatment usually takes a long time and in extreme cases should be implemented by a skin doctor (dermatologist).",

  "description": "Suspicious skin lesions are most commonly mentioned in relation to a suspected skin cancer. Especially the A-B-C-D-E rule for the screening of moles and birthmarks helps to separate harmless birthmarks from suspicious ones. A stands for Asymmetry, lesions that are asymmetric are suspicious. B stands for Border, suspicious are lesions with uneven borders. It is said that these are lesions that can’t be clearly circled with a pen. C stands for colour, meaning the colouring of the birthmark. Suspicious here are birthmarks with a variety of colours. D stands for Diameter, suspicious are moles with a diameter larger than 6mm. E stands for Evolving, suspicious are moles that are evolving above the skin level. Repeatedly bleeding or not healing wounds, even without a birthmark may be the so-called white skin cancer, especially if it occurs in typical regions. Typical regions are parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, face, hands, forearms, for women also the décolleté, for men also the scalp.",
  "descriptionShort": "A suspicious skin lesion is most commonly mentioned if it shows one or more of the symptoms below: Noticeable moles (that are asymmetric or have uneven borders, a variety of colors, changing rapidly, itching or bleeding), not healing wounds, especially in typical regions (parts of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as face, scalp, neck, décolleté, forearms and hands), noticeable scales, itching. Changes to the skin, especially suspicious ones should be examined by a doctor – ideally by a dermatologist.",
  "medicalCondition": "A suspicious change of the skin might be caused by an infection in or on the skin such as a wart. The virus of a wart is transmitted through skin contact. Shingles or chickenpox that happens throughout the body can also trigger suspicious changes of skin. Birthmarks are changes of skin that are usually present since birth. Some suspicious changes can follow a sensitivity or an allergic response triggered by conditions such as diabetes or poor circulation. Autoimmune illnesses like psoriasis can also trigger changes on the skin. Most cancers are detected through obvious signs such as sickness, pain, tenderness, bumps or lumps. However, it is difficult to identify a change of skin since the change is not often obvious. The detection of a suspicious change of skin is tricky because usually this change happens gradually and without clear signs. However, it is recommended to use always a thumb to feel for any change while making the difference between normal and unusual detail. A person should pay attention to lesions, moles, and spots present on the body in order to compare it with details that seem different. Other signs include changes happening on a mole such as bleeding, oozing or the presence of a nodule or bump, pain, tenderness or itchiness. Other signs that should be considered as a warning are a new engorgement beyond the limit, redness or a tenderness that is hard to heal. A pigment that spreads from the boundary of an area into the skin all around should be a warning sign as well.",
  "treatment": "Suspicious skin lesions can occur at any age. If an affected person observes a lesion that matches the criteria mentioned above, or worries for other reasons, he should consult a doctor, ideally a dermatologist. If the doctor finds the skin lesion suspicious as well, it will usually be removed surgically. A pathologist will evaluate the removed tissue under a microscope. If the suspicion is confirmed, the doctor will discuss the next steps with the affected person. Depending on the pathologist’s findings, the previous surgery may have been sufficient, but sometimes a larger area around the lesion might be needed to be removed, or further therapy (chemo-, radiotherapy) may be necessary.",

Anyone can experience otitis media but the condition is most common in children between six and fifteen months old. According to some studies, 1 in each 4 children are affected by the condition before their tenth year of life. Otitis media accompanies often various respiratory infections including flu and common cold. This is due to the connection of the middle ear with the upper respiratory tract through a small channel called the Eustachian tube. This tube is so thin that microbes that are existing in the sinus cavities or nose penetrate into the middle ear over the Eustachian tube and begin growing. There are numerous subtypes of Otitis Media. These types include adhesive otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and acute otitis media.",

  "medicalCondition": "The causes of aphthous stomatitis are unknown. However, it can be related to a weak immune system, imbalanced nutrition, allergy or even stress. Some mineral and vitamin deficiencies, blood diseases, trauma, Crohn’s disease, and allergies cause similar ulcers. Aphthous stomatitis sores are confused often with cold sores that are caused by a herpes virus. According to its size and further characteristics, aphthous stomatitis can be classified into three types. First of all, if the sore is smaller than one centimeter, then it is called minor aphthous stomatitis. Second, if the sore is bigger than one centimeter, then it is called major aphthous stomatitis. The major type also includes more than one lesion at the time, longer duration than 10 days and eventually even scars after healing. Third, if the sores are extremely small but somehow they merge together, then it is called herpetiform aphthous stomatitis, this name is due to its similar look to a herpes simplex virus infection. People with aphthous stomatitis will feel pain or tingling inside their mouth, which may cause a difficulty to speak normally or to eat. The affected person may feel a tingling or burning sensation in an inflammed area right before the appearance of the ulcer. In order to form fully, an ulcer takes 2 to 3 days. The sores are symmetric, shallow and round. This means that the sores are the same on all sides and are painful. The painful phase lasts three to ten days. The sores are usually found on the inner area of the tongue, cheeks, and lips.",

Too much food, or eating too fast is suspected to cause hiccups, as well as fast drinking, cold or gassy drinks, or, very traditional, somebody is thinking of you. In these cases, the hiccups don’t last long and disappears spontaneously. However, there are also some documented causes for hiccups, including concussion and irritation of the diaphragm nerves. A heart attack can also cause hiccups, as does pancreatitis. Heartburn is also a common cause for hiccups. In some cases, hiccups can last for days, up to years, often caused by heartburn or sometimes concussion. But in most cases the cause is unknown.",
  "descriptionShort": "Hiccups are a reflexive contraction of the diaphragm, causing a fitful inhalation of air. The inhaling process is stopped by a quick closure of the vocal folds, so that the typical “hic” can be heard. It can be caused by an irritation of the diaphragm because of extreme stomach filling, cold, gassy drinks, consumption of alcohol or inflammable irritations.",
  "medicalCondition": "With repeated reflexive inhaling, talking becomes difficult. Long-term forms can cause various complications such as sleeping disorders, hypoxia and depressions. The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than 48 hours include swallowing air with sucking on candy or chewing gum, sudden changes of temperature, emotional stress or excitement as well as eating and drinking too much alcohol or carbonated beverages. Hiccups that last over 48 hours can be triggered by different factors including irritation or nerve damage, central nervous system disorders such as tumors, traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, meningitis and encephalitis. Drugs and medical disorders such as tranquilizers, steroids, kidney failure, electrolyte imbalance, diabetes, barbiturates, anesthesia, and alcoholism can cause also long-term hiccups. The only sign is the characteristic sound of a hiccup. Sometimes, the only symptom is a little tightening feeling in the throat, chest or abdomen that precedes the sound.",
  "treatment": "Because the cause is unknown in most cases, usually only the symptoms of hiccups can be treated, if necessary. Treatment can include a variety of home remedies, such as holding breath for a long time or exhaling into a paper bag. A variety of medication can be taken for chronic hiccups, but which one leads to the desired success has to be identified by trial-and-error. If the cause is known (e.g. heartburn), it can be treated (e.g. gastric acid blockers). Once the heartburn subsides, the hiccups will subside as well. Hiccups are generally harmless, but can be burdensome for the patient.",

  "description": "Anorexia, also called anorexia nervosa, is a psychological disease in which affected persons suffer from a disturbed body perception. This causes them to feel much too overweight and unattractive and to suffer from it. They will then try to counter this perception with various measures. Those can range from strict monitoring of food intake to a complete refusal to eat. People who are affected by anorexia avoid eating sufficient quantities of food and attempt to speed up their loss of weight by vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive athletic activity. The reason for this is their warped perception of their figure. As a result of these actions, the body weight is reduced to a body mass index value under 17.5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the body’s weight (in kilograms, Kg) with the square of the body’s height (in meters). The BMI for a person of normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to people with anorexia, people with only bulimia (see the article on bulimia) have a BMI value over 17.5.",
  "descriptionShort": "People with anorexia suffer from a misperception of their own body. These are mainly young women.

Anorexia is characterized by a severe restriction of nutrition and an intentionally induced underweight state with the patients trying to lose even more weight.",
  "medicalCondition": "Women are affected most often, but not exclusively. As mentioned above, patients’ symptomatology or behaviour often begins with monitoring their food intake with calorie charts. This is then often followed by measures to significantly reduce weight, including excessive exercise, vomiting, laxatives, but also consumption of appetite suppressants as well as foregoing many foods. Affected persons do not like to eat in company anymore and will take a very long time to eat even smallest amounts of food.",
  "treatment": "The insufficient supply with calories, but more importantly with vitamins and other essential nutrition can cause serious or even life-threatening physical symptoms. A low body weight can lead to hormonal disorders, such as irregularity or absence of menstruation. Men with anorexia may experience loss of potency and sexual drive. When the body fails to receive sufficient nutrition, bones can no longer rebuild themselves, which can lead to the early development of chronic osteoporosis. In rare cases it can lead to a reduced heart rate and body temperature, which requires an urgent trip to the hospital. Treatment of anorexia requires a specialist and is extremely important, as undernourishment can be fatal under certain circumstances. Treatment often occurs over a long period of time and relapse is common. In the event of acute life-threatening weight loss, induced nutrition, e.g. via a gastric tube or high-calorie drinks will be the initial treatment, followed by intensive psychotherapy and nutritional counselling.",

People with bulimia often maintain a normal or slightly reduced weight above a body mass index value of 17.5.

Symptoms can occur in the digestive system or in other areas of the body. A person affected by a sensitivity to gluten will have a reaction in his small intestine which is triggered by his immune system, whenever he eats gluten. This reaction, over time, damages the lining in his small intestine, which prevents the absorption of certain nutrients. This malabsorption can lead to serious complications and can affect development and growth in children.",

Because of this narrowing, the valve is unable to open itself completely and this makes it hard for the blood to flow from the heart into the aorta and to other parts of the body. This obstruction forces the heart to work more in order to propel blood to the body. This additional work limits eventually the quantity of blood the heart can pump. This makes the heart muscle weak. If the narrowing is mild, symptoms might not be present. In severe condition, symptoms can be present and a surgery will usually be recommended to stretch or remove the affected valve and replace it. Without treatment, the narrowing of the aortic valve can cause severe complications for the heart.",

  "descriptionShort": "Mitral valve insufficiency is a common valvular defect. It occurs when the mitral valve of the heart is unable to close tightly. This condition enables blood to move back into the heart. This makes the blood unable to flow efficiently through the heart or to other parts of the body, making the breath short or the body tired.",
  "medicalCondition": "Mitral valve insufficiency often affects older patients, but it can also occur in young people during a bacterial or rheumatic infection of the valve. Patients often do not notice any symptoms for a long time. Symptoms can be shortness of breath, palpitations, and night coughing attacks. If valve damage suddenly arises, water can quickly accumulate in the lungs (edema of the lungs).",
  "treatment": "Slight forms of mitral valve insufficiency are relatively common and harmless and usually require no treatment. Only serious forms that cause complaints require treatment by a specialist, as it will develop into arrhythmia and result in overstress of the heart.

This leads to the bones becoming fragile, so that they break easier or spontaneously. Frequent fractures of e.g. vertebral bodies, thigh- or forearm bones can occur.",
  "medicalCondition": "Osteoporosis mainly affects elderly persons and, within this group, mainly women. Most common reason is a vitamin D deficiency; in women it is mainly hormonal changes after the menopause that causes calcium and phosphate to dissolve from the bone. The bone mass decreases, the bones are not as robust anymore and typical fractures and related pain occur. Spontaneous fractures (without any hit- or push-impact) most commonly occur in the vertebrae, but also in the pelvis or the forearm. Low bone-stability leads to frequent typical fractures that can occur either spontaneously or following slight traumata.",
  "treatment": "Blood tests and bone density measurements with certain x-rays can help the doctor to diagnose osteoporosis. Besides tending to existing fractures, treatment will depend on the identified causes. A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D as well as regular exercise are very important in the prevention and reduction of bone loss. Foods that are high in calcium include dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese), dried figs, almonds, sesame seeds, cod liver oil, salmon, and chicken eggs. Because vitamin D is produced predominantly after sun exposure in the skin and is not easily absorbed from digested foods, it’s recommended that people from 65 years onwards use calcium and vitamin D dietary supplements to prevent osteoporosis. If the presence of osteoporosis is confirmed in a bone density test (a densitometry or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DXA), treatment with calcium and vitamin D should be started immediately. Additionally, a class of medications called bisphosphonates may be used to stop further bone loss. Often intake of vitamin D and calcium can be sufficient, but sometimes more comprehensive measures may be necessary.",

It is also important to treat depression early. A healthy lifestyle such as regular physical exercise, healthy balanced diet with a healthy weight, moderate drinking and not smoking can reduce the risk of developing the condition. Alzheimer’s is a progressive condition. This means that, over time, more parts of your brain are impaired and this leads to more symptoms that develop. These symptoms that are mild at the beginning can become more severe and interfere with daily life. Some symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are common but one has to keep in mind that everyone is unique. The condition will not be experienced exactly in the same way by two distinct people. For most patients, memory gaps are the first symptoms experienced. The affected person will commonly lose everyday items such as glasses and keys somewhere in the house or be unable to learn new information and remember recent events or conversations. He will have difficulties to find the suitable word, lose track of the date or day or become confused. Many people lose interest in hobbies and activities and become withdrawn. As the disease progresses, the patient is no longer able to carry out such everyday tasks as physical hygiene, getting dressed, or eating and drinking.

  "description": "Tick-borne encephalitis is an infectious viral infectious disease which impactes the central nervous system of a person. Over the past decades, TBE has become an increasing public health concern in Asia and Europe and it is the most important viral tick-borne disease which exists Eastern Europe, Central Europe as well as Russia.",
  "descriptionShort": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an infectious viral disease transmitted by ticks and in certain cases it can lead to inflammation of the brain or the meninges. There are three forms of the disease related to the virus subtypes: namely, Siberian, Far Eastern and European.",
  "medicalCondition": "Ticks that carry the TBE virus are widespread throughout the TBE-belt (Eurasia). One to four weeks after being bitten by an infected tick, flu-like symptoms such as headaches, lethargy, fever, and joint pain occur. In most cases the illness disappears after that. However, in 5-15% of those affected, after a symptom-free period, a new wave of illness develops into meningoencephalitis (inflammation and infection of the meninges and brain), which is experienced as headaches, sensitivity to light, dizziness, and impaired walking.",
  "treatment": "Paralysis of the limbs or facial nerves is rare in cases of TBE, but the disease is fatal in 1% of those who contract it. There is no treatment for TBE, but the symptoms can be alleviated. There is a vaccine for the TBE virus and people who live in or often visit high-risk areas for TBE are advised to get the vaccine. Tips for dealing with tick bites: 1) One can prevent tick bites by wearing long sleeves and pants, staying out of the under bush and areas with tall grass, and checking oneself for ticks after the excursion. 2) If the person is bitten by a tick, he should remove it from his skin with a pair of tweezers (some tweezers are made especially for this purpose) without crushing the tick and then disinfect the bite area. One should not use oil or other substances to “suffocate” the tick - this will only cause the tick to expel any pathogens it carries.",

  "description": "Chickenpox is an infection by a varicella-zoster virus that commonly affects children and is highly contagious. In fact, the condition is so common in childhood that most of adult persons are immune to it because they have had it before. With some children there are only some spots but with others it can be possible to see their entire body covered with spots. The common areas affected include the legs and arms, the belly and chest, beneath the arms, scalp and ears, and on the face. Children catch usually chickenpox in spring and winter, between March and May.",
  "descriptionShort": "Chickenpox is an infection caused by a varicella-zoster virus that is highly contagious. Most cases are in children below the age of 15. It spreads very easily from one person to another. The typical symptom of chicken pox is an itchy, uncomfortable rash. In adults the virus can become active again and lead to shingles.",
  "medicalCondition": "The highly contagious disease occurs primarily in children and can be seen as a skin rash over the entire body, with small, reddish, and itchy blisters. The risk of infection starts 1 to 2 days in advance to the appearance of blisters until the decrease of crusted wounds (usually 5 to 6 days after the rash has started). After the illness has run its course, the virus continues to reside within the body (inside certain nerve cells) and can become activated again later in life or in individuals with compromised immune systems. This infection is called shingles or herpes zoster and appears as a localized, very painful skin rash. The disease is contagious in people who have not yet had the varicella virus. In older people, pain may continue for several weeks or even months after the rash has disappeared. The disease usually runs its course without complications or consequences. Patients with pre-existing conditions such as neurodermatitis or weak immune systems may have a worse experience. Newborn babies are also greatly at risk of an infection. Chickenpox is considered a moderate disease when it occurs in children, but the affected skin areas can be extremely itchy and the child can have multiple symptoms ranging from fever, to feeling irritable even to feeling miserable.",
  "treatment": "Chickenpox doesn't have a particular treatment however medication can improve the symptoms. Mostly what happens is that the affected children's blisters start to crust up and then fall off by themselves within a timeframe of up to two weeks. A kid who has the disease should be kept away from public places so that the risk is reduced of infecting other persons who may not have had it. It’s also recommended that contact with pregnant women should be avoided, as an infection early on in the pregnancy or towards the birth can put the baby into serious health risks. Normally the treatment for chichenpox consists of medicine which reduces the urge to itch. Salves can also be used to dry out the blisters. With herpes zoster, anti-viral medication can be used to shorten the duration and intensity of the disease. A vaccine exists for children and youth against varicella and there is also a zoster vaccination for seniors over 60.",

  "medicalCondition": "Heart attacks affect men twice as often as women and are usually associated with the hardening of the arteries (artherosclerosis). Risk factors and precautionary measures can be found in the coronary artery disease article. The signs of a heart attack include intense, long lasting chest pain (angina pectoris), with possible radiation into the throat or the left arm, usually associated with shortness of breath, feelings of anxiety, nausea, and a cold sweat. Some people may feel pains around their stomach. Triggers for a heart attack include vigorous physical effort, stressful situations and significant fluctuations in blood pressure.",
  "treatment": "If a heart attack is identified too late, the coronary muscle turns to scar tissue and can lead to heart failure, arrhythmia, or pulmonary edema (water in the lung). A visit to the hospital is a must for anyone experiencing the symptoms named above. If it’s treated soon enough, part of the heart muscle and the life of the patient can often be saved. A small procedure to install a thin stent into the coronary artery can help to keep the clogged artery open and reestablish blood flow. Stent or no, medications need to be taken throughout the rest of the individual’s life to prevent a second episode. Medications may include aspirin, cholesterol lowering drugs, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors.",

In some cases, there may be no typical symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. If symptoms do occur, patients often notice a pain similar to that of sore muscles in the affected leg (usually your calf), sensations of tension or weight, swelling, a warm sensation in the region of the clot and pain when pressed, and red skin, particularly under the knee at the back of your leg. Deep vein thrombosis affects usually one leg, although not always. The pain may be worse when patients move the bodyweight from their foot upward towards their knee.",

There you can be fitted with compression stockings to wear every day. These stockings will help prevent complications and improve your symptoms. The doctor may also prescribe blood thinners to prevent further clotting and to decrease the risk of a pulmonary embolism considerably. For those who travel long distances it’s recommended to stand up regularly and to move around or at least to do some calf exercises while sitting. Preventative therapy with short-term blood thinners is something that can be considered as well.",

Vitamin D deficiency is common in countries with less sunshine, since natural vitamin D can only be formed when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Since the population don’t get enough sunlight during the year length and protect often from sun exposure with sun lotion during summer time, the bodies are not able to produce this necessary vitamin. It’s possible to get some vitamin D through dietary supplements, such as cod liver, salmon, chicken eggs, and beef liver, but the amount of vitamin that these sources provide is not sufficient.",
  "descriptionShort": "Vitamin D deficiency is a regular condition. Vitamin D plays vital roles for numerous functions within the body including reducing inflammation, promoting cell and bone growth, keeping normal levels of phosphate and calcium, and promoting the absorption of calcium. For these reasons a lack of Vitamin D can commonly lead to osteomalacia in adults or rickets in children.",
  "medicalCondition": "Numerous factors can lead to lack of vitamin D. A firm vegan regime for a long period can deprive the body from the sufficient amount of vitamin D since animals are the natural providers of this vitamin. A limited exposure to the light from sun can also lead to vitamin D deficiency since the body produces vitamin D when the skin is exposed to its light. A limited exposure to the light from the sun can happen when a person puts on long dresses or covers themselves for religious motives, or have activities that keep them away from the sun. People with dark skin are also at risk of vitamin D deficiency since the ability of the skin to produce Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight is reduced by the pigment melanin. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused also by the inability of the kidney to convert this vitamin to its active type. This can happen in case of disease or ageing process. This deficiency can also be caused by the inability of the digestive tract to absorb adequately vitamin D. This can be the result of some medical issues such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and cystic disease that affect the ability of the intestine to absorb the vitamin from the food eaten. Obesity can also cause vitamin D deficiency as fat cells extract the vitamin from the blood, fluctuating its discharge into the circulation. Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency include muscle weakness and bone pain. However, many people have subtle symptoms. Yet, deficiency of vitamin D can expose the body to health risks such as cardiovascular disease, severe asthma, cancer, and cognitive impairment. A vitamin D deficiency in children can lead to rickets, a condition in which bone development is arrested. Adults can suffer from osteomalacia. ",
  "treatment": "Because the population is chronically deficient in vitamin D, it’s recommended nowadays that all people older than 60 take vitamin D with calcium as food supplements. It has been shown that muscle power increases based on that and that the bone loss (osteoporosis) can be positively influenced as well as the frequency of falls can be reduced. As the diseases related to a deficiency of vitamin D can be critical it is important for a potentially affected person to find a suitable therapy with help of a medical doctor in order to reach the necessary level.",

Obesity is widespread in developed countries and is one of the three most avoidable conditions and causes of death. Obesity usually develops as a result of over-eating, meaning that the amount of food consumed exceeds the amount of calories used.

BMI is a measure of whether a person has a healthy weight for his height. Obesity in the vast majority of cases is caused by overeating and physical inactivity.",
  "medicalCondition": "Obesity is caused generally by consuming more than needed calories, especially those contained in sugary and fatty food. These calories are burnt off through physical activity and the body stores the excess energy as fat. The condition is an increasingly common issue since many people living in modern societies eat excessive quantities of high-calorie, cheap food while spending a lot of time sitting in cars, on couches or at desk. Some underlying health conditions can contribute also to weight gain, as an example hypothyroidism. However these conditions usually do not cause problems if they are controlled effectively with medication. Some of the signs of obesity include a higher than normal waist circumference and body mass index, having additional fat around the waist, clothes are feeling tight and the person needs a larger size of clothes. In addition, the scale shows that the person has gained weight. In some cases, metabolic syndrome may occur simultaneously.

Treatment usually consists of a long-term change in diet that includes a reduction in calorie intake, regular physical activity, and behavioral group therapy. Certain medications can also be prescribed to aid weight loss. The goal of therapy is not to lose weight quickly, but slowly and permanently. In exceptional and extreme cases of obesity (morbid obesity - BMI of 40 kg/m2 or higher), treatment via gastric bypass surgery can be discussed as an option.",

External causes are the easiest to address and include low humidity and cold temperatures, particularly during the winter when people use central heaters. Also, they include an overuse of cleaning agents and sanitizers, over-washing with harsh soaps, the evaporation of water after a swim or bath, improper use or choice of moisturizers and some medicine such as drugs for acne, allergies, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Internal causes include a personal medical history of other diseases such as atopic dermatitis, genetically caused conditions, and age related issues or the overall health situation of a person. People with thyroid diseases are more disposed to developing dry skin. The symptoms and signs include red plaques, rough dry skin and itching.",
  "treatment": "For treatment of dry skin, it’s recommend that the affected peron uses an oil-based product when bathing instead of the usual soap product. After bathing, one should apply a moisturizing cream to the skin that will reestablish the skin’s barrier. After that he can use a store-bought body lotion for daily treatment. It is recommended to talk to a doctor or dermatologist if eczema, serious itching, or a skin infection occurs.",

Since then, the incidence of mumps had been reduced dramatically.

  "medicalCondition": "Tennis elbow occurs when a muscle is overused and strained. The main cause is frequent contraction of the muscles located in the forearm. People use these muscles to lift and straighten their wrist and hand. The recurrent movements cause a stress to the tissue and this can trigger a sequence of small fissures in the tendons that connect the muscles of the forearm to the bony bulge at the external side of the elbow. Playing tennis, particularly recurrent usage of the backhand thrust with inadequate technique can also cause the condition. Other common movements of the arm are also among the causes. These movements include frequent use of the computer mouse, driving screws, cutting up meat or other ingredients for cooking, painting and using plumbing instruments. The pain connected with the condition may spread from the external side of the elbow into the wrist and forearm. Weakness and pain can make it hard to hold a cup, turn a door handle, grab an object or shake hands.",
  "treatment": "Treatment includes medication (analgesics), physical measures (cryotherapy) and support, such as bandages.

When the damaged vein is located close to the surface of the skin, the condition is called superficial phlebitis.

Inflammation of the vein is most common in the legs, but is also (though less) likely to develop in the arms after an infusion treatment. Swelling occurs in the area around the infected vein and is red, warm, and painful.",
  "medicalCondition": "The cause of superficial phlebitis is often unclear. The condition can result from a medical procedure including the use of an intravenous catheter or line. Minor injuries caused to present varicose veins can also cause superficial phlebitis. Numerous factors can trigger deep vein thrombosis such as clotting disorders, damage to the inner lining of the vein, genetics, some forms of cancer, paralysis that makes the person inactive for a long period of time, prolonged inactivity including sitting for a long moment in a plane or car or lying for longer periods in bed following a surgery, and any condition that slows the blood stream. Symptoms vary depending on the inflammation site. Superficial phlebitis comes with symptoms including light fever, burning or itching in the inflamed area, swelling, tenderness, or warmth in affected zone, and redness along the canal of the vein. If the affected zone is lowered, such as the leg, specifically in the morning, this can worsen the symptoms. Superficial phlebitis is rarely serious but uncomfortable. In case of clotting, the affected vein feels cold or hard beneath the skin. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is often without symptoms. The rare symptoms include swelling, redness, and warmth in the inflamed zone. This form of phlebitis is dangerous since the clot of blood stuck in the vein can move and head to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain potentially able to cause death.",

This leads to an acute infection. Chronic infection is also caused by Candida yeast but a bacteria can also be the origin. Since yeast grows well on wet environments, this chronic infection is caused often by having the hands or feet in water for a long period of time.

Home treatments are often very effective for mild cases. Soaking the infected area numerous times per day in hot water and applying antibiotic ointment is recommended. If the infection is not showing improvement with home treatments or if it is more severe, a doctor can prescribe an antibiotic to be taken orally. It might also be needed to have abscesses or blisters cut and drained of fluids in order to speed the healing and relieving the discomfort. ",

However, if the affected person has an anal fissure that has not healed after eight to twelve weeks, then the condition is considered as chronic fissure and may need further medical treatment.",
  "descriptionShort": "An anal fissure is a tear in the skin or the anal mucosa and is usually painful during bowel movements. Anal fissure does not lead to more serious issues. It is a common problem that affects people of all ages, particularly also young and healthy people.",
  "medicalCondition": "An anal fissure can develop due to constipation or diarrhea, after giving birth, from certain sexual practices (such as anal sex), or due to other medical issues with the anus. An anal fissure is very painful and leads to increased tension in the sphincter of the anus. This in turn worsens constipation and creates a negative feedback loop. An anal fissure may bleed or even cause itching.",
  "treatment": "The danger of anal fissures is that symptoms remain unhealed (and become chronic). New anal fissures need to be treated with medication and an increase in dietary fiber (such as is found in vegetables). Medications can relax the sphincter and restore blood flow to the site. If this treatment shows no results, surgery becomes necessary.",

  "descriptionShort": "Ankle injuries are often associated with sport injuries but one does not need to be an athlete in order to twist and hurt it his ankle. Simple things such walking on a rough surface can cause a debilitating and painful sprain. The most often occuring ankle injuries are sprains fractures.",
  "medicalCondition": "An ankle injury occurs when the joint of the ankle is contorted too far out of its regular position. The condition develops mostly during activities related to sports. However the condition can develop even while walking on an irregular surface since such areas force the ankle and the foot into a position that is not natural. Another factor that may lead to the condition is the unusual position of the ankle when a person with loose-fitting clogs, sandals or high-heeled shoes walks. Other factors likely to trigger an ankle injury include rotating the ankle, rolling or contorting the ankle, an abrupt impact including during a car collision, landing after a jump in an uncomfortable position, and falling or slipping. The symptoms of a rupture or fracture and of a twist are very alike and comprise the inability to carry weight or walk on the damaged joint, swelling, bruising, often sudden and sharp pain. That explains why a person should immediately have a medical visit to have the injury assessed.",
  "treatment": "If the injury affects only the ankle’s ligaments, no surgery is necessary. A temporary immobilisation with a plaster-splint, elevation, local cryotherapy and decongestive medication can be applied. In most cases, a preventive blood thinning needs to be prescribed to prevent the risk of thrombosis that can be caused by the immobilisation. After six weeks, a stable ligament recovery can be assumed. If the ankle injury also causes a fracture of the lower leg bones, in most cases a surgery is necessary to stabilise with plates and screws. A long-term consequence, for example following a meniscus injury, is a higher risk of arthrosis.",

  "description": "Patients with myopia are suffering from a defective vision, where far away objects cannot be perceived in focus. The visual perception happens in the retina, which is located inside the eyeball. To picture observed objects on the retina, the light entering the eyeball needs to break exactly on the level of the retina. The eye manages this refraction with support of the lens, which causes a stronger or a lighter refraction, depending on the distance of the object. Is the lens’ refraction too strong, or, to put it differently, the eyeball too long, far away objects cannot be perceived in focus anymore. This defective vision is called myopia.",

Patients perceive objects located far away to be unfocused and blurry, whereas nearby objects located close are seen sharply and normally. Lots of people suffer from shortsightedness.",
  "medicalCondition": "In case of myopia, the ball of the eye is relatively too long to concentrate the power of the lens and cornea of the eye.

The condition occurs also when the lens or cornea is too bent for the length or size of the eyeball. Myopia happens also in some cases when these two factors are combined. The condition starts typically in childhood and people with parents suffering from myopia are more likely to develop the condition. In most cases, myopia stabilizes at the beginning of adulthood but can progress sometimes with age. People with shortsightedness find it hard to see clearly distant objects and read correctly road signs. However, these people can read easily close writings and use computer. Other symptoms and signs of short-sightedness include headaches, squinting, and eye strain. When the condition is not corrected, the person can feel tired when playing sports or driving. It is important to consult a doctor or ophthalmologist if a person experiences these symptoms or signs while wearing contact lens or glasses.",

  "description": "Inside of the eye is the retina, in which optical perception takes place. In order for observed objects to be imaged correctly on the retina, the light that enters the eye needs to be refracted exactly on the surface of the retina. This refraction is achieved with help from the lens, which controls how much the light from an object is refracted depending on its distance. If this refraction is too weak or if the eyeball is too short, objects nearby may not be perceived clearly.",
  "descriptionShort": "Farsightedness or hyperopia is a vision condition in which the patient can see distant objects clearly but cannot focus properly to close ones. The patient perceives objects that are closer as blurry. Hyperopia occurs when the cornea has too little curvature or the eyeball is too short, making it hard for the eye to focus the light that penetrates it correctly.",
  "medicalCondition": "Farsightedness is relatively common and usually happens in the context of presbyopia, which becomes more common with age. Patients notice that the closer an observed object is to the eye, the blurrier it seems to be. One of the causes of farsightedness is a flat cornea. Further causes can be a short eyeball which is shorter than normal, that can cause the light to concentrate behind the eye's retina rather than on it. Family history is also among the causes of farsightedness. The condition develops often in adults as the lenses of the eyes age. It is difficult for people with farsightedness to see anything up close. They have to work hard in order to see close things and this causes strain in the eyes. This extra strain causes some symptoms of farsightedness. The symptoms include blurry vision up close, fatigue, tension, squinting in order to see better, a burning or aching sensation around the eyes, and a headache after tasks such as reading that require to concentrate on something up close. When the condition has not been corrected and diagnosed properly in children, some of them may develop strabismus or crossed eyes.",
  "treatment": "The eyes of young people can compensate for farsightedness since their lenses are still flexible. This is hard for aging eyes that require glasses for close-up tasks including sewing or reading. The condition can be corrected in the simplest way by getting prescription contact lenses or eyeglasses with converging lenses (“plus” lenses). Such lenses or eyeglasses are corrective as they change the way light enters the eyes and compensating the insufficient refractive power of the lens, helping the patient to concentrate better. Another way to treat farsightedness is refractive surgery that may cause some severe complications.",

  "description": "Superficial mycosis is when the skin, mucous membranes, or nails are affected. If the fungus affects organs deeper in the body, then it is referred to as a systemic mycosis. Fungi that cause superficial mycosis are divided into three groups: dermatophytes, yeast, and molds. Molds usually only affect people with compromised immune systems. An infection by dermatophytes or yeast can occur in the context of diabetes or pregnancy. Yeasts colonize warm and moist areas of mucous membranes and skin folds. Skin folds, the mouth, genitals, and nail cuticles are susceptible to a fungal attack for this reason. Molds possess active components that can destroy callused human skin and eclusively attack the skin, hair, and nails. Fungi are found in soil, on animals, and can be transmitted between people.",
  "descriptionShort": "Mycosis is a fungal infection of animals and humans. Mycoses are common and its development can be assisted by a variety of physiological conditions. Mycoses start often on the skin (superficial) or in the lungs (systemic) and affect millions of people.",
  "medicalCondition": "Depending on the location of the fungal attack, the skin may show different signs of infection. A yeast infection manifests as a reddish, inflamed area of skin surrounded by flaking. A fungal infection of the mucous membranes in the mouth can produce a white film that can be wiped away, with a felty feeling as well as troubles to taste. A fungal infection on the genitals is accompanied by itching and discharge in women and itchy, white nodes and blisters in men. An infection by mold produces disc-shaped foci that have an elevated, reddened, and flaky margin. If the infection is located between the toes, then the skin is white and chapped. An infection of the scalp with hair presents either on the entire scalp or in several areas as redness with dry flaking and hair loss. An attack on the nails can happen via small injuries or from circulation disorders and manifests as yellowing and thickening of the nails.",
  "treatment": "The key for favorable results are early diagnosis, prompt use of appropriate antifungal treatment, and efforts to enhance the immune system. Antifungal drugs, usually creams, are prescribed to treat mycoses, except for example in the case of an infection of the nails and head. Most of the drugs are over-the-counter medicine. Some drugs can be administered intravenously for fungal infections that show resistance to other types of treatment. For fungal infections of the feet, keeping the feet dry is especially important to treatment.",

  "descriptionShort": "Neurodermatitis (Atopic dermatitis) is a chronic inflammation of the skin in typical areas. It occurs when the skin becomes itchy with a patch appearing on the spot.

The patient can develop numerous itchy spots, classically on the ankle, forearm, thigh, wrist, or neck.",
  "medicalCondition": "Atopic dermatitis often occurs during the first months of life, but may also develop only in schoolchildren or adults. Since the symptoms change with the patient’s age, it is categorised in different stages. In infants it is called infantile eczema. The skin, especially on the head or the cheeks is reddened, oozing and itching. Scales and crusts occur. During childhood, the redness mainly occurs in the face, throat and neck, and is especially strong on the crook of the arm and the hollow of the knee, as well as the backs of hands and feet. The other skin is usually very dry. The often agonizing itching leads to children scratching a lot, and even waking up during the night because of the itches. Scratching causes tears of the inflammatorily changed skin, leading to additional inflammatory reactions. Eczema in adults affects mainly the forehead and eyelids, but also crooks of the arm, hollows of the knee and the backs of hands and feet. The skin becomes thicker and the lichenification is clearly visible.",
  "treatment": "The most important component of treatment is prevention. Breastfeeding (at least 6 months, no feeding of porridge before 4 months of age) can prevent the onset of infantile atopic dermatitis. If no breastfeeding is possible, the baby should be fed with hypoallergenic milk products (commercially available). Important is also a very good skin care with moisturizing creams and bath additives. An avoidance of contact with substances to which you are allergic, is not always possible, but at least the reduction of contact should be sought. If symptoms continue, your doctor may prescribe ointments or tablets depending on the severity of case.",

  "treatment": "In most cases, a reflection of the ocular fundus can show a retinal detachment clearly. Treatment should be started immediately; otherwise the affected eye might go blind. For smaller detachments it might be sufficient to stick the retina together in their immediate environment, for bigger detachments, a more comprehensive surgery might be indicated. For more complicated retinal detachments, the removal of the vitreus body could become necessary. Generally, about 95% of retinal detachments can be treated without severe complications. Especially in case of spontaneous retinal detachments, the other eye might get affected after some time, an ophthalmologist regularly for check-ups.",

  "description": "Dyslipidemia is an imbalance of lipids (cholesterol and fat) in the blood. There are different fats present in the blood, including cholesterols, triglycerides, as well as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). An imbalance of blood lipids (for example, an increase in VLDL, LDL, and IDL as well as a decrease in HDL) can lead to calcification of the blood vessels as well as a heart attack or stroke. Dyslipidemia is often associated with other diseases such as abdominal obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Types of dyslipidemia are organized according to their causes. Causes may be bad eating habits as well as other diseases such as diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, kidney disease, genetic diseases, or medications (cortisone, diuretics, birth control) or pregnancy.",
  "descriptionShort": "Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism (handling of lipoproteins in the body), which is either resulting into lipoprotein deficiency or overproduction. The condition can encompass an elevation of the total cholesterol considered as the bad lipoprotein of low density and a decrease in the concentration of good cholesterol or lipoprotein of high density in the blood.",
  "medicalCondition": "About 50% of the population above the age of 40 in developed countries suffers from some sort of dyslipidemia (especially high cholesterol levels). The blood vessels of patients with increase blood lipids are prone to hardening of the vessel walls (arteriosclerosis), which can lead to heart attacks, stroke, and circulation disorders in the limbs (peripheral artery disease). Besides that, patients with high blood lipid levels may also suffer from pancreatitis. Storage of blood lipids in the liver may also occur, which can lead to fatty liver disease (steatosis of the liver) or hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). Furthermore, it can lead to fat depositions in the skin known as xanthomas.",
  "treatment": "If blood lipid levels can be lowered, then the risk of a heart attack and overall mortality will also be significantly reduced. Healthier levels can be achieved through medication, an improvement in dietary habit, weight loss, and regular physical exercise. Besides that, other illnesses that cause increased blood lipids should be treated properly and alcohol should be avoided.",

Panic attacks are short term, suddenly set in, and are accompanied by fears related to the body (such as dying or suffocating) and by pronounced physical difficulties. Generalized anxiety attacks are characterized by lasting several months, associated with stress, worry, and fear.",
  "descriptionShort": "An anxiety disorder is a psychological disorder in which the affected individual experiences anxiety due to unspecified triggers, certain circumstances, or situations which limit their everyday capabilities.",
  "medicalCondition": "Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychological disorders. The chances of experiencing an anxiety disorder at some point in life are 10-15%. Women are twice as likely to suffer from anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are often accompanied by depression and abuse of medication. People with anxiety disorders suffer from anxiety coupled with physical ailments. These may include heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, being dazed, hot flashes, chills, dry mouth, tremors, and crawling sensations on the skin. Long term anxiety disorder can lead to avoidance behaviors like running away or social withdrawal.",
  "treatment": "Anxiety disorders can be treated relatively well with pscicological therapy. Anti-depression treatment may also be pursued to support other efforts. It’s common for a panic attack to spontaneously occur and disappear. In between, the patient should seek psychotherapeutic help and antidepressants if necessary. The same applies for general anxiety disorders.",

Other illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, increased blood lipid levels (cholesterol), and nicotine promote hardening of the vessels. In certain cases, the arteries can become clogged with blood clots, which can be caused by arrhythmia of the heart or abnormal vascular dilation. Supply to the tissue is reduced when vessels become clogged, which typically leads to effort related pain in the affected areas.",

  "medicalCondition": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is especially common in older patients (affecting 3% of people over 60) and predominantly affects the legs. Slowly developing hardening of the vessels causes the patient to suffer from effort related, burning cramps and pains in the area below the blockage in the artery. Furthermore it can lead to cool and pale tissue (skin), rest pain when the affected body part is in an elevated position, venous ulcers (leg ulcers), and tissue death in the worst scenario. If blood clots are present, the symptoms mentioned above occur quite rapidly.",
  "treatment": "In the worst cases, tissue death can occur. In certain circumstances an amputation may be necessary. A work-up is usually carried out when typical symptoms occur and includes an accurate evaluation of the narrowness of the vessel using ultrasound and other methods. Treatment in the early stages may consist of walk therapy, blood thinning, and avoidance of triggers such as nicotine. In order to prevent the last stage of tissue death, sufficient supplies of blood need to be guaranteed. This can be done by means of catheter intervention in which the vessel is reopened with a balloon or by means of a bypass operation in which the narrow passage is by passed either by an artificial or natural vessel.",

At first, osteoarthritis is felt as joint pain, causing loss of ability and often stiffness. Pain can be noticeable upon beginning of movements or during strenuous physical work.",
  "treatment": "Advanced osteoarthritis can cause defective positioning of the joint as well as limitations to movement. Knees, hips, and fingers are all commonly affected. Therapy for osteoarthritis seeks to reduce pain and also to avoid any bone changes. Weight reduction in the case of obesity and regular, gentle exercises for the purpose of maintaining function in the joints are both important factors in treatment. If necessary, painkillers such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or local steroids may be prescribed. Additionally, substances that slow the process of damage to the cartilage may be incorporated into treatment. At the end stage of osteoarthritis, an operation to replace the affected joint with an artificial one often improves symptoms and quality of life.",

These types of injuries often occur during grinding work when safety goggles are not worn. Deep eye injuries can occur during work with a hammer and chisel or when striking a hammer against stone and metal. Splinters can dismantle from the source material and enter the eye at high speeds (causing small, deep injuries). Deep eye injuries can also happen in the home (with scissors, knives, or other pointed instruments) or in the event that eyeglasses shatter (causing large, deep injuries). Patients usually notice small, deep injuries when they feel something hitting the eye and then experience a sudden impairment in vision. Because the cornea can heal itself quickly in the case of small injuries, such as a stone splinter, there is generally no loss of vitreous humor (fluid within the eye). In the case of large, deep injuries, the cornea remains torn, fluid spills out, the pupil changes its shape, and the lens becomes clouded. The eyeball weakens and can collapse.",
  "treatment": "In the case of superficial injuries, the patient usually receives eye drops that numb the cornea so that the doctor can remove any foreign objects from the eye. Operation is usually necessary for most deep eye injuries in order to remove the object and to close the wound. Its possible that after these measures full vision is not restored.

  "treatment": "Basal-cell carcinoma can be surgically removed. The treatment requires large areas of surrounding tissue to be removed, to assure that all tumor is excised. If an operation is not possible due to any number of reasons, another option is to treat the tumor with radiation. This method is not as guaranteed as surgical removal and after several years the skin may show signs of radiation damage. If you have basal-cell carcinoma, your doctor can talk to you about which method is the best for you. Metastasis is very rare for basal-cell carcinoma. After the tumor excision, relapse is possible, though not frequent. Furthermore, the risk of developing basal-cell carcinoma in other parts of the body is increased by 50% after having a first tumor. An annual checkup after the removal of a tumor is recommended for the purpose of identifying additional lesions.",

Frequent contact with various chemical substances, smoking, frequent urinary tract infections, as well as radiation therapy can favour the development of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer generally originates in the cells lining the bladder (ureothelial carcinoma, also called transitional cell carcinoma). It may have a single point of origin (unifocal), but usually there are several foci (multifocal). There are multiple degrees of severity of bladder cancer depending on how advanced tumor growth is, which structures in the bladder wall are affected, and even if other surrounding organs are affected. Treatment depends on the severity of the cancer.",
  "descriptionShort": "Bladder cancer is when there is a growth of abnormal tissue, called tumor, that develops in the bladder lining. The most common symptom is blood in the urine which usually occurs painless. The tumor can spread, in some cases, into the surrounding muscles. Bladder cancer is a malignant cancer type. It affects older men three times more often than women.",
  "medicalCondition": "Patients usually end up visiting a doctor when they notice blood in their urine (macrohematuria) without the presence of any pain. Besides blood in urine, other symptoms during urination can occur. Advanced stages may present with flank pains, which are due to the poor transportation of urine from the kidneys into the bladder. In about 20% of cases there are no symptoms accompanying bladder cancer. Routine urine analysis can find a microscopic amount of blood in the urine (microhematuria) and signs of white blood cells in the urine.",
  "treatment": "If the symptoms listed above appear, then an ultrasound should be done to eliminate the possibility of other diseases. Next, an endoscopy of the bladder is performed, which allows a view of the bladder’s surface. Abnormalities around the bladder can then be cleared or samples can be taken. Sometimes it’s possible to obtain cells to determine if the type of cancer. This is done with repeated flushing of the bladder via a urinary catheter. To determine whether it’s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in combination). The decision must be made on an individual basis for each patient. Discussing options with your doctor is highly recommended.",

Venous insufficiency can have various causes. Standing for long hours, but also sitting with the knees bent impairs the reverse blood flow, so that the valves have to stand higher pressure. A family-induced weakness of the connective tissue can further cause the venous valves not to close properly. The resulting pressure increase in the veins leads to enlarged veins (sometimes visible as varicose veins) and further symptoms, which allow the condition to be separated in three stages.",
  "descriptionShort": "Chronic venous insufficiency involves the failure of venal valves to close properly, so that the blood-flow, especially to the legs, is slowed down. The blood can’t properly flow “uphill”, increasing pressure inside the veins and leading to the typical symptoms.",

The skin around the ankles can look dark blue (Corona phlebectatica), and the veins in this area are clearly visible. In stage two, the oedema are more or less strong, reddish-brown skin alterations appear along the lower leg, the skin becomes thin and a stasis dermatitis, a strongly itching skin inflammation caused by congestion, may occur. In stage three, all symptoms mentioned before can still be observed, and additionally the patients suffer from recurring wounds and ulcers that heal very slowly, especially above the inside of the ankle. Night cramps and a tingling sensation of the legs can occur at all stages.",
  "treatment": "Increasing ankle oedema and heavy, painful or even open legs lead the patient to see a doctor. Vessel sonography and an x-ray of the veins with contrast agents confirm the diagnosis; identify the affected parts and help planning the therapy. Conservative treatments include support stocking of compression class II, alternatively the legs can be wrapped with short-stretch bandages or a zinc paste bandage. Long standing and sitting should be avoided for the benefit of lying and walking. Kneipp applications (hot/cold sequence showers) support the venous blood return, as well as the activation of the muscle pump, the active ankle movement, whereby the lower leg muscles work and basically “squeeze out” the veins. If an ulcer already exists, it needs to be cleaned and the dead tissue needs to be removed, followed by a frequent and lengthy treatment with wound dressings and compressions. When the ulcer doesn’t heal or gets infected again and again, surgical measures may be considered. A surgical treatment of varicose veins can be an option as well, depending on the stage and the affected areas. Other options can be ligature of all affected veins in the groin (crossectomy), vein stripping, ligature of all connecting veins between superficial and deep venous system, sclerotherapy or laser therapy. Which therapy, if any, is recommended for each case mainly depends on the prior imaging.",

After surgery, glucocorticoids may have to be taken as a tablet, usually for a limited period, until the remaining adrenal gland has assumed the function of the removed gland. The treatment of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome is a cessation of glucocorticoid therapy (or at least a reduction in the dose, a termination is often not possible).

For stages 1, 2, and 3, a more invasive surgery known as a partial colon resection is required to remove the part of the colon that is cancerous. 2) Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells: patients with stage 3 colon cancer normally receive chemotherapy for 6-8 months after surgery. It is also used to reduce symptoms and to prolong the survival of patients with stage 4 colon cancer. 3) Radiation therapy to destroy the cancerous tissue is usually used in the presence of rectal cancers to reduce their size before surgery. Most important in prevention of colorectal cancer is a regular check-up with a colonoscopy for people older than 50 years.",

Due to the shrinking back of the eyelid (from inflammation and scarification of the elevating muscle of the upper eyelid), the cornea becomes dry, causing conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers. Eye movement disorders can cause the patient to see double. The prominence of the eyeball is a result of the expansion of the muscles and fatty tissue in the eye sockets.

  "description": "The epididymis is the coiled tube located behind the testicles, and it is mainly responsible for the storage and transportation of sperm. Epididymitis is a condition when there is an inflammation in the epididymis.",
  "descriptionShort": "Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis. Males of any age can be affected. The causes can vary, but the most common cause is an infection. The treatment often includes medications such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers. Rest is advocated for relieving symptoms.",
  "medicalCondition": "Epididymitis mainly results from bacterial infections. The bacteria may infect the epididymis through the urinary tracts such as the urethra, bladder, and even the prostate. Therefore, if people have infections of related areas, the risks of getting epididymitis will also be higher. However, sexual contact is the most common cause of infection. In elderly persons the underlying cause is often a bladder infection or an infection of the prostate, which expand on the epididymis. In younger man sexually transmitted inflectional diseases, such as chlamydial and gonococcal infections, are the main causes. Besides bacterial infections, epididymitis can also be caused by an injury of the groin, bladder emptying disorders, or use of amiodarone, which is a type of heart medication that may inflame the epididymis. People with epididymitis may have symptoms such as blood in the semen, discharge from the urethra, groin pain, lump sensitive to pressure next to the testicle, pain during ejaculation or urination, and painful scrotal swelling. Typically the pain develops slowly over hours or days and will not appear from one minute to another.",
  "treatment": "The treatments of epididymitis will depend on the causes. However, medications such as antibiotic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers can help to reduce the infection, inflammation and pain. In addition, people with an epididymitis are advised to have proper bed rest, elevation and ice packing of the affected area. This will help reducing pain.",

  "description": "Epilepsy can develop due to several causes ranging from an abnormal brain structure (presence of scars from infection, tumors, trauma or malformation) to metabolic disorders, excessive consumption of alcohol, or genetic predispositions. A seizure happens when the brain’s nerve cells fail to function correctly. Symptoms are stereotypic for each patient, depending on the area of the brain that the electrical discharge takes place. Generalized seizures (Grand Mal seizure, absence seizure) affect both hemispheres of the brain and are distinguished from focal seizures that only affect specific regions of the brain without the patient experiencing loss of consciousness.",
  "descriptionShort": "Epilepsy is a chronic disorder and its characteristic is unprovoked, recurrent seizures. Many people with epilepsy have over one type of seizure and can have also other symptoms of neurological issues. The epileptic attacks are accompanied by a loss in consciousness, muscular convulsions, a change in muscle tone, and changes in perception.",
  "medicalCondition": "Epilepsy occurs in 0.5% of the population. Seizures occur in different frequencies and at different intervals. Patients usually experience warning signs before a seizure such as nausea, feeling hot, or unusual and indescribable feelings. Sleep deprivation and alcohol withdrawal as well as hard breathing can trigger a seizure. A Grand Mal seizure is the most common form of epilepsy and presents as loss of consciousness, falling, muscle cramps, and muscle convulsions. After several minutes, a period of confusion and drowsiness follows until the patient regains normal awareness. The patient cannot remember the event. During the seizure the patient may bite their tongue, urinate, or defecate. In contrast, an absence seizure presents as an acute disruption in awareness without a deeper loss of consciousness and usually occurs in children and youth. It can manifest as discreet signs such as blinking, slight twitching, or absent-mindedness. Absence seizures usually occur several times a day and can be triggered by quick breathing. Simple focal seizures involve muscle twitching that it limited to a specific area or sensations on the skin. Acoustic and visual sensitivity can also be symptoms of epilepsy. Patients often remain conscious. Complex focal seizures involve déjà vu phenomena, feeling of insubstantiality, hallucinations or even heart-racing and difficulty in breathing. The patient’s gaze becomes rigid, the patients perform chew- and lick-movements and produce retching sounds.",
  "treatment": "If the patient can’t recover between two seizures, they can develop a so-called Status epilepticus. This is dangerous, because the disrupted breathing can cause an undersupply of the vital organs as well as the brain. Antiepileptic medication is used for therapy. Patients should avoid provocation factors such as excessive consumption of alcohol. After two years without any seizure, the medication may be discontinued.",

Drainage of blood from the penis is reduced by the closing of the veins, causing an increased amount of blood to accumulate in the penis, from which an erection results. Other medical conditions such as (a) venal issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and dyslipidemia, (b) an issue with the nerves such as paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, dementia, epilepsy, or (c) hormonal imbalances such as low testosterone or hyperprolactinaemia may be responsible for erectile dysfunction. Psychological issues such as fear of failing to perform sexually, depression, stressful experiences, and dysfunctional partner relationships can lead to erectile dysfunction. Additionally, it’s possible that nerves responsible for having an erection could have been damaged during a prostate operation or there could be side effects from medication.",

The patient suffers from the inability to achieve an erection to have sexual intercourse despite being sexually aroused.",
  "treatment": "Possible causes need to be evaluated and eliminated, appropriate medication can be administered, and a testosterone replacement therapy can be put in place. For psychological causes, psychotherapy is the first course of action. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (such as Viagra®) can be used to improve the flow of blood into the spongy body. Pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, liver insufficiency, and serious retinal diseases require other treatments. Other medicinal drugs can be injected directly into the penis.

This kind of pregnancy usually cannot continue to birth. It is strongly recommended to remove the embryo to prevent severe damage to the mother.",
  "medicalCondition": "As mentioned, a normal egg cell will be fertilized in the oviduct and then travel from oviduct to the uterus, and implant inside the wall of uterus. However, there are several conditions that can cause the fertilized egg to implant somewhere else but not within the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy happens mostly in the oviduct. Ovary, cervix and abdominal cavity are other places where an ectopic pregnancy may occur. The most common cause is an obstruction (stenosis) of an oviduct, which can prevent the fertilized egg from entering the uterus. Such obstructions occur due to scar formation, typically after infections of the female reproductive system (adnexitis), but also after surgery and after a previous ectopic pregnancy in the oviduct. Another well-known cause is endometriosis, which can increase risks for ectopic pregnancy and other difficulties in pregnancy. The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can be abnormal vaginal bleeding, low back pain, mild cramping on one side of the pelvis and pain in the lower pelvic area. Often this condition will lead to an inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis) and its typical abdominal pain, which exacerbates on mild pressure of the abdomen and on physical activity. A regular pregnancy test will also be positive in case of an extrauterine pregnancy.",
  "treatment": "An ectopic pregnancy is very dangerous for a pregnant woman. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth. The treatment of ectopic pregnancy includes surgery and medications that end the pregnancy. For the common case of the ectopic pregnancy being located in the oviduct, the tube will bloat due to fetal growth, it will cause severe pain and may rupture.

While ganglion cysts can develop in anybody, they occur mostly in women starting at the age of 20 up to 40. People with osteoarthritis in the finger joints near to the nails of their fingers are most likely to develop the condition close to those joints. People who have injured their tendons or joints in the past have also a higher risk of developing ganglion cysts. A ganglion cyst is usually painless. The pain can occur when a cyst presses on a nerve but even small cysts can cause muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, or pain. Large ganglion cysts form noticeable lumps. Most people consult a doctor because of motion restriction and cosmetic issues.",
  "treatment": "Since ganglion cysts are often painless, there is no need for treatment. Doctors can recommend a watch-and wait-strategy. In case of pain or interference with joint motion, the doctor can recommend immobilization since activity can cause the cyst to grow larger. Immobilization of the affected area can be done with a splint or brace for a short time to make the cyst shrink and to relieve pain. Doctors can also suggest aspiration or surgery if other approaches have failed. However, the cyst can recur even after surgery.",

  "medicalCondition": "Hallux valgus tends to run in families and women are more affected than men. Other causes may comprise arthritis, other syndromes or illnesses such as Marfan syndrome and cerebral palsy. Inappropriate shoes that do not fit correctly can contribute to the occurrence of the condition since tight shoes may rub against the big toe joint and high-heeled shows may squeeze the feet, causing the big toe to be stuck in a leaned position. Such position keeps the big toe stretched. The nerve around the big toe will be pressured, triggering pain. In addition, high heels push most of the body weight forward onto the front part of the foot, which puts significant strain on the joints of the toe. The main symptom of the condition is the big toe directing in the way of the other toes present on the same foot. This may lead to the foot bone linked to the big toe to point outwards. Secondary symptoms may comprise sore skin above the upper part of the hallux valgus, red, callused and hard skin generated by the overlapping of the great toe and the following toe, swelling and pain over the joint of the great toe. Changes to the form of the foot may make it hard to find appropriate shoes and wearing shoes may then trigger a pressure that makes the pain worse. In addition the affected person may also experience a bony, swollen lump on the external brink of the foot.",

  "descriptionShort": "In a hiatal hernia parts of the stomach bulge up into the chest through the diaphragm at the site where the oesophagus enters the abdomen. It is also known as diaphragmatic hernia. It can be separated in two different types of hernia.",
  "medicalCondition": "Throughout life, the elastic fibres‘ functionality declines. Additional factors such as obesity, which increases pressure inside the abdomen, can cause this weakness to develop faster, resulting in a hiatal hernia sooner. Approximately every fifth adult suffers from hiatal hernia. Many patients experience heartburn, because gastric juices can enter the oesophagus easier. Para-oesophageal hernia causes mainly symptoms due to displacement of and pressure on the abdominal organs, especially swallowing disorders and belching, but also cardiac arrhythmias.",
  "treatment": "Treatment generally begins with a gastroscopy. This way, a hiatal hernia can be diagnosed, but the form can’t be verified. Nonetheless, the gastroscopy is important to rule out other conditions or complications such as gastric ulcers. An x-ray in combination with swallowing a contrast medium allows the differentiation in axial or para-oesophageal hernia, or a combination of both. The treatment depends on this differentiation. An axial hiatal hernia that causes no symptoms usually doesn’t need treatment. In case of oesophageal hernia, a combination, or an axial hiatal hernia that causes symptoms, surgery should be considered to avoid complications and consequential damages.",

The pressure can also mean that the tissue of the brain is swelling. This swelling can be caused by a disease such as meningitis or an injury in the brain. The condition can cause an injury to the brain. For a healthy adult, the normal measure of intracranial pressure is between 7 and 15 mmHg. When this measure reaches 20 to 25 mmHg, a treatment is required to reduce it.",
  "descriptionShort": "Increased intracranial pressure is a condition when the pressure inside the skull is higher than normal. It can be dangerous and cause serious problems. It usually results from brain injuries, and it can also lead to further brain damage. People with increased intracranial pressure usually require immediate medical treatment, and the medical team will try to solve the underlying causes.",
  "medicalCondition": "The causes of increased intracranial pressure include 1) a congestion of cerebrospinal fluid (liquor) in brain and spine, which results in a rise of pressure and the so called hydrocephalus 2) a rise of pressure in the brain, which results from brain tumors, aneurysm rupture and other subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain inflammation (encephalitis) and meningeal inflammation (meningitis), and stroke. 3) head traumas and injuries, which lead to bleeding in between the skull and the meninges (epidural and subdural hematoma). Increased intracranial pressure can be dangerous and cause serious problems. For example, people with increased intracranial pressure often have symptoms that may include behavior changes, consciousness changes or loss, pain in the head, lethargy, neurological deficiency (such as rigid pupil), seizure and vomiting. In patients with slowly increasing and chronic increased intracranial pressure symptoms like urinary incontinence, equilibrium disorders and dementia are observed.",
  "treatment": "Increased intracranial pressure needs an immediate medical treatment. People with increased intracranial pressure should be hospitalized in order to find the underlying health issue causing the problem. The treatments usually include: 1) breathing support, 2) lowering the pressure in the brain by draining fluid (liquor) from inside the skull, 3) medication to reduce the pain and decrease the pressure, and 4) in severe cases, temporarily removing part of the skull may be necessary.",

It has clear borders and does not spread to other tissue. 2) Malignant brain tumor: this tumor contains cancer cells and does not have clear borders. It can be life threatening because it can spread to other tissues and grow rapidly. 3) Primary brain tumor: it starts in cells of the brain and can spread to other parts of the brain, but rarely to other organs. 4) Secondary (Metastatic) brain tumor: this tumor originates from other parts of the human body and then spreads to the brain. People with brain tumors can experience various symptoms. It can cause a headache, visual disturbances, seizure, personality changes, poor coordination and gait, short-term memory loss, vomiting, lethargy and the like.",
  "treatment": "Treatments of brain tumors depend on the cause, type, location and severity. Normally the supportive treatment includes drugs such as anti-seizure or antiepileptic drugs, steroids and sometimes surgery. Steroids decrease the swelling of the brain and antiepileptic drugs may help to prevent seizures. In addition, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are also commonly used to treat malignant brain tumors.

This often happens with premature infant boys.",
  "descriptionShort": "A disturbed testicular descent, also called cryptorchidism, describes when one or both testicles are not present in the scrotum. Normally the testicles will move into the scrotum within the first 6 months after birth. If not, early treatment like hormone injection or surgery can prevent a further damage. ",
  "medicalCondition": "Normally, testicles will move into the scrotum at the latest within the first year after birth. The cause of a disturbed testicular descent is still not totally clear, hormonal disorders are very likely involved. It’s well known that disturbed testicular descent happens more often to early-born than regular-born infants. However, there are other factors such as genetic problems, maternal health or environmental issues that can affect the hormone levels and the normal development of testicles. There are distinguishable types of cryptorchidism: 1) Retractile testis: it is located most of the time in the scrotum, but gets retracted in the inguinal canal due to an inordinate cremaster reflex. There is usually no treatment necessary. 2.) Gliding testis: it is located in the inguinal canal. It can be pulled in the scrotum by physical examination but then slides back. Hormonal therapy or surgery is necessary. 3.) Abdominal testis, inguinal testis, obstructed testis and ectopic testis: in those forms the testis is never located in the scrotum. Hormonal therapy or surgery is necessary. If a disturbed testicular descent is not found or cured earlier in time, the testicles may lose their function and lead to reduced fertility. At the same time, the risk of getting a testicle cancer may also increase in the affected testicle.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of a disturbed testicular descent includes a hormone therapy or a surgery. The hormone therapy can induce the undescended testicle to move into the scrotum, but its success rate is only about 20%. If the therapy does not work, then a surgery with fixation of the testicle into the scrotum is necessary. Depending on the localization of the testicle, surgery can also be first line therapy.",

The two common types of testicular cancer are: 1) Seminoma: this type grows slowly and it is typically located only in the testes, however there is a risk that it may spread to the lymph nodes. 2) Non-seminoma: this type is more common than Seminoma and grows faster than seminoma. Symptoms for testicular cancer are usually an unpainful swelling of one of the testicles and sometimes some pain.",
  "treatment": "Treatments of testicular cancer include the surgical removal of the testis affected with cancer as well as nearby lymph nodes. In Seminoma, radiation therapy is often prescribed after surgery to lower the recurrence rates, and in non-seminoma, chemotherapy is usually more successful.

  "description": "Technically, foodborne diseases are not an infection but the intestine's reaction to toxins produces by bacteria in spoilt food. Dairy and egg products, meat and potato salad are examples for food that spoils fast. Enterotoxinogenic bacteria are most commonly staphylococcus aureus, and sometimes bacillus cereus or clostridium perfringens. The toxin of staphylococcus aureus, which frequently causes foodborne diseases, is heat resistant. That means that even by heating up spoilt food to 100°C for more than 30 minutes do not destroy those toxins, so that they can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after eating.",
  "descriptionShort": "Foodborne diseases are caused by substances that are produced by bacteria in spoilt foods. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur within a few hours after eating. Diarrhoea and vomiting after eating are therefore commonly referred to as food poisoning. Foodborne diseases are the body's reaction to degradation products or poisons from bacteria.",
  "medicalCondition": "Characteristic for foodborne diseases are the typical symptoms within 1 to 16 hours after eating the spoilt food. Usually all persons who consumed the food will suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, often accompanied by cramp-like stomach pains. The symptoms usually occur within few hours after consuming the affected food. With the exception of the very rare botulism, patients fully recover without any long-term consequences.",
  "treatment": "The typical symptoms described by all persons who consumed the affected food within 1 to 16 hours point to foodborne disease. Nonetheless, an infection, e.g. salmonella or norovirus should be taken into consideration as well. In cases of doubt, the enterotoxins can often be established in the spoilt food. The symptoms typically last for 1 to 2 days. Therapy is purely for the symptoms. Most important is the replacement of liquids and salts, and in some cases antispasmodic medication. Especially older patients or children may require in-patient treatment with infusions, to regulate the liquid- and salt balance. Generally it is important to make sure that foods bought or consumed are fresh and not spoilt. It is also important to know that even heating up foods can't remove certain bacterial toxins.",

In advanced stages, chemotherapy might be indicated prior to the surgery, to reduce the tumor. Structures often affected by metastases (lymph nodes, fat layers of large and small intestines) will be removed as well. Survival time depends on the tumor stage and operability.

Pain relievers and self-care may reduce discomfort. For severe cases, a hormone treatment or surgical removal may be chosen.",
  "medicalCondition": "The exact causes of mastopathy are unknown. It is assumed to be an imbalance between the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. Women with excessive amounts of estrogen compared to progesterone are susceptible to having mastopathy. Mastopathy usually affects women aged 30-50 years and disappears after menopause. Mastopathy is classified into three grades: 1) simple mastopathy (70%), 2) proliferative mastopathy (20%) and 3) severe mastopathy (10%). People with mastopathy may experience symptoms such as tension and pain in the breast, palpable and swollen nodules, and even fluid secretion from the nipples. Grade three mastopathy has the risk of developing into a tumor.",

It can be dangerous if it’s not found in the early stages. Surgery to remove the affected area is usually necessary. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy are also used in some cases.",
  "medicalCondition": "The cause of melanoma is the abnormal changes in melanocytes (pigment containing cells). Risk factors are: Sunburns in the childhood and youth, immunosuppression, genetic factors (white race, albinism, xeroderma pigmentosum and affected family member) and dysplastic nevi (=abnormal dark birthmarks). There are several types of melanoma: 1) Superficial spreading melanoma: the melanoma has flat but irregular shapes and different colors. 2) Nodular melanoma: the melanoma is not flat but raised. The raised areas are normally black and dark blue or red. This form is especially malignant because it tends to spread into the depth of the skin, which makes metastases more likely. 3) Lentigo maligna melanoma: the melanoma rises on base of a lentigo maligna. This skin alteration often appears due to over-exposure to sunlight, especially on the face, neck and arms. 4) Acral lentiginous melanoma: the melanoma often appears on nails, palms, soles and mucosa. 5.) Amelanotic melanoma: a nodular melanoma without dark pigmentation. Possible indications of melanoma based on the acronym ABCDE include 1) Asymmetry: it often is unevenly shaped, 2) Borders: the edges are irregular, 3) Color: the melanoma has different colors (very dark and brighter areas in the same lesion), 4) Diameter: the melanoma is usually larger than 5mm in diameter, 5) Evolution: it may change in appearance, either in size or color.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of melanoma is to surgically remove the affected areas including a safety distance. Additional chemotherapy can kill the cancer cells to prevent the cancer from returning. Immunotherapy with medications like interleukin or interferon can be used to strengthen the immune system to fight against the cancer. Radiation therapy can be used if a patient cannot get surgery for reasons like bad general condition or a concomitant disease. If there is any suspicious symptom of melanoma, it is recommended that you consult a dermatologist for early intervention because the risk for metastases is directly depending on the depth of the melanoma.",

All Symptoms are the result of a nerve failure caused by a focus of inflammation and are therefore as various as the locations of these foci. An often seen but not necessary first symptom is the loss of sight on one eye due to an inflammation of the optical nerve (neuritis nervi optici). Multiple sclerosis may among others lead to symptoms such as abnormal movements, thoughts, and sensations. For example, people with MS often suffer from weakness of the muscles and show a handicap in movement such as abnormal walking patterns or inability to walk. Other symptoms are numbness, tingling sensations, coordination problems, imbalance, memory problems and changes in personality, fatigue, loss of bladder or bowel control.",

Thus, this incompatibility can consistently also be referred as being normal. The human gut loses in the course of life the ability to break down lactose and to digest it.

This explains why it is important to check moles and visit a doctor or dermatologist regularly if moles get suddenly larger, their border becomes irregular, get inflamed or darker, shows some changes in their color, starts itching, cracking, or bleeding, or becomes painful.",
  "treatment": "A self-monitoring moles is important. As soon as an irregularity (asymmetry), a fuzzy boundary, a color change, an increasing growth, itching or bleeding is noticed, go as soon as you can to a dermatologist. It could be that a atypical mole is a malignant melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer type. It is particularly important to ensure adequate sun protection (sunscreen, long sleeves, caps or hats) and to get regular medical checks.",

Larger stones, however, need to be broken up with medication, shattered with sound waves, or removed with a ureteroscope. Removal is necessary, as kidney stones that clog up the ureter can cause urine to back up or they may cause an infection in the upper urinary tract (see the article on pyelonephritis), which can damage the kidneys.",

  "description": "Ulnar nerve entrapment, or cubital tunnel syndrome, is a condition that involves stretching or pressure to the ulnar nerve. The common symptoms of cubital tunnel syndrome include numbness or unresponsiveness and tingling in the little finger and ring finger. The nerve runs in a groove on the inner side of the elbow. Baseball pitchers are among the persons who are likely to develop the condition. This is because these players have to twist their hands in order to throw a slider. This motion can injury delicate ligaments that are within the elbow. The entrapment of the ulnar nerve is the second most common cause of nerve entrapment in the body. The most common is carpal tunnel syndrome with entrapment of the median nerve.",
  "descriptionShort": "Ulnar nerve entrapment is a condition due to irritation and compression of the ulnar nerve (nervus ulnaris) of the arm. The cause is mostly located at the cubital tunnel (sulcus ulnaris), where the nerve is most exposed to outer influences. The ulnar nerve is located in the arms so the symptoms often affect the fingers, hands, forearms and elbows. People with the problem are usually treated with medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), wearing splints, occupational therapy and in some cases surgery.",
  "medicalCondition": "The main cause of ulnar nerve entrapment is the compression of the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel (sulcus ulnaris). There are many conditions that can cause compression of the ulnar nerve. For example, keeping the elbow bent for a long period may compress the ulnar nerve and then lead to ulnar nerve entrapment. In addition, fractures, bone spurs, swelling of the elbow joint, cysts near the elbow joint and repetitive activities may also increase the risk of getting the condition. Since the ulnar nerve can affect movement and sensation, if it is injured an abnormal sensation and weakness in some muscles may occur. The common symptoms include: weakness or muscular atrophy in the hand (especially the abduction of the fourth finger is weakened), tingling or numbness in the palm and fourth or fifth finger, sensitivity to cold and tenderness in the elbow joint. A typical phenomenon is a tingling sensation in the fourth finger during percussion of the cubital tunnel.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of ulnar nerve entrapment includes medication, accessory appliances, occupational therapy and sometimes surgery. Generally speaking, medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to reduce the pain and inflammation. Also, wearing splints can help to immobilize the elbow to facilitate recovery. Occupational therapy may be recommended to strengthen and regain muscle power. In some cases, surgery may also be considered in order to relieve discomfort.",

At certain levels, this accumulation of fluids in the calf is normal when sitting or standing for a long time. But a larger amount of fluid accumulation that does not decrease after walking or lying down should be examined more thoroughly.

  "treatment": "Accumulation of fluids itself is not usually dangerous for the patient. One exception is pulmonary edema (edema of the lungs), which can develop due to a weak heart. The cause for edema in the legs determines the health-related consequences. The most common case is of weakness in the vain valves in the legs (chronic vein insufficiency), which can lead to an insufficient supply of blood and oxygen to the skin, affecting wounds on the calf to heal slowly or poorly. Treatment for leg edema is possible with the use of compression stocking and long term treatment of wounds. In rare cases, operation is necessary. If a kidney or heart issue is found to be the underlying cause of edema, then diagnosis by a doctor is absolutely necessary to establish proper treatment, since it may be a serious condition.",

When the patella stays dislocated, people may have symptoms such as deformity of the knee, a bent knee, inability to move the knee, pain, swelling and tenderness of the affected knee.",
  "treatment": "When a patellar luxation occurs, the affected person can try to straighten out his knee if possible. If it is stuck or too painful to move, then one should stabilize the knee and seek prompt medical help In order to relocate the patella under anesthesia. After a patellar luxation, it is recommended to wear an immobilizer for several weeks to prevent moving the affected knee. Physical therapy can help to regain the muscle strength and rehabilitate the knee. For severe cases, surgery is necessary for reposition. Surgery also can help to avoid regular luxations of the patella.",

Even though a perianal thrombosis looks a lot like a hemorrhoid, it shall not be confused with it, as the treatment is quite different.",
  "descriptionShort": "A perianal hematoma describes a collection of blood that is located under the surface of the skin at the edge of the anal opening. Usually it will heal by itself after a period of time. An analgesic may be used to relieve the pain, or a small surgery may be indicated in order to excise the perianal thrombosis and facilitate a speedy recovery.",
  "medicalCondition": "A perianal hematoma is usually caused by a traumatic rupture of a small blood vessel in the anal area due to increased pressure that results from straining. The causes of perianal hematoma include constipation, injuries while lifting heavy weights or riding a bike, working out often in the gym, severe coughing fits, surgery via the anal opening, trauma while introducing medical instruments, sitting for long periods of time, and pregnancy. A perianal hematoma manifests as a purple swellings on the edge of anus and it can either be soft (like fluid blood filled cavern) or hard (like a blood clot). Perianal thromboses vary in size from 2 till 8 cm. They cause pain which may vary from mild to severe range. Because of the pain, the patient is often unable to sit. The pain is aggravated by sitting, walking and during bowel movements.",
  "treatment": "A perianal hematoma is not a serious problem and usually resolves spontaneously after a period of time. Conservative treatments like cold compresses and regular sitz-baths can help to reduce the swelling and pain. Patients can also use analgesics to relieve the pain. Ointments and topical cream are also recommended. Conservatively treated, a perianal thrombosis either resolves (as small ones often do) or drains due to a lesion in the perianal skin (as bigger ones often do). A doctor may suggest surgery to excise the perianal hematoma. If it is detected and excised within the first two days, the pain will be alleviated immediately and the healing process will be much speedier.",

  "descriptionShort": "Whooping cough is an infectious bacterial disease that causes uncontrollable coughing. It is a highly contagious disease that can be very harmful to infants and young children. The early symptoms are like a common cold, so it is usually diagnosed not until the characteristic coughing attacks occur. Vaccination can prevent getting whooping cough and antibiotics can be used to treat it.",
  "medicalCondition": "Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium bordetella pertussis. It is highly contagious for non-vaccinated people, because when an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny germ-laden droplets are sprayed into the air and can be breathed into the lungs of anyone who happens to be nearby. People with whooping cough normally start with cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, a mild fever, and a minor cough. This makes a clinical differentiation between whooping cough and a cold or flu very hard without specific testing. After 1-2 weeks of being infected, the cough begins to get worse and lasts for several weeks. The coughing is often described to make a characteristic barking sound. Sometimes the cough is so violent that it can cause breathlessness or vomiting. People with whooping cough often have symptoms including violent and uncontrollable cough, dehydration, nausea as well as vomiting, difficulty in breathing, pale skin and fever. It can be deadly for infants or young children.",
  "treatment": "To prevent getting whooping cough, already infants should take vaccines. Once infected antibiotic drugs can be used to treat whooping cough. Antibiotics can treat the infection, but it cannot treat the cough. Additionally, also cough medications often cannot improve the condition of coughing satisfyingly. It is recommended to use humidifier to keep the air moist to alleviate the symptom of coughing. People with worsening condition will need to be hospitalized to prevent a further lung infection.",

  "treatment": "A doctor can receive a first evidence of pheochromocytoma with a 24h blood pressure measurement and various further blood or urine tests. An ultrasound, computer tomography or magnetic resonance tomography can confirm the diagnosis. Eventually, options for tumor removal should be considered. The definitive treatment is surgery and until the tumor is removed, a doctor should control the patient’s blood pressure regularly. An endocrinologist should be consulted.

This can lead to an inflammation, however it is also possible that the inflammation can occur without fluid accumulation, which is then called dry pleurisy. Any person can get the condition and there are several factors which can cause it. Pleurisy is described as a syndrome of chest pain identified by a harsh pain in the chest that becomes worse when breathing. This condition can be painful and debilitating, disrupting activities and causing issues with breathing. Such issues can even put the patient’s life in danger by causing a lack of breath. If any pain occurs in the chest during breathing, it is really important to visit a doctor since this could be the start of the condition or the deteriorating complications from a medical condition already present within the body. Pleurisy can be preventable, but it happens generally in individuals that have bad lifestyles and are in general less healthy.",
  "descriptionShort": "Pleurisy is an inflammation occurring in the pleura, the movable layer (membranes) between lungs and inner wall of the chest (thorax). A variety of underlying conditions can cause pleurisy. The treatment of pleurisy includes medication, drainage or even surgery. However, it is important to identify the underlying disease.",

People with pleurisy may experience the main symptom which involves pain in the chest. Coughing and taking a deep breath may also worsen the pain. In addition, coughing, fever and shortness of breath are also common symptoms. Pleurisies can be class-divided in two forms that can merge into each other. The dry pleurisy (pleuritis sicca) is common in early stages and leads mainly to breath-related chest pain. The wet pleurisy (pleuritis exsudativa) is characterized by a pleural effusion, which means there is a big amount of fluid in between the pleural membranes in the pleural space. Wet pleurisy is often less painful but leads commonly to symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of pleurisy will depend on the causes. In cases with pleural effusion, the fluid should be drained for relief of symptoms and in order to examine it for determination of possible causes. For example, bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. Pulmonary embolism may be treated with anticoagulants. Autoimmune diseases commonly get treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The treatment of pleurisy often includes the use of pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. In severe cases, surgery will be necessary.",

  "description": "Rheumatic fever is a disease of the skin, joints, heart, and (rarely) the brain, which can form after an incorrectly (or non-)treated bacterial infection of Streptococcus pyogenes. Group A streptococci often cause an infection of the tonsils. Complications can be, similar to an allergic reaction, a polyarthritis and endo-, myo- or pericarditis, in rare cases also rheumatic nodes in the skin and an attack on the nervous systems (chorea minor).",
  "descriptionShort": "Rheumatic fever is a result of certain bacterial infections (Streptococcus Group A), causing pain of the joints (polyarthritis) and the heart (endo-, myo- or pericarditis). It occurs often when a scarlet fever or strep throat is not treated appropriately. It is an inflammatory illness and a complication of scarlet fever and strep throat. The condition is most common in children between 5 and 15 years old. Acute rheumatic fever can occur also in adults and younger children. The condition is rare in developed nations but common in numerous developing countries.",
  "medicalCondition": "10-20 days after a Streptococcus pyogenes infection of the mouth, nose and throat area, the rheumatic fever occurs. Patients suffer from generic symptoms such as fever, headache and sweating, in addition to the typical migratory joint pain with painful swollen and overheated joints. Involvement of the heart rarely causes noticeable symptoms, but it should be checked repeatedly, especially for possible heart valve destructions. If the skin is involved, typical circular rashes and rheumatic nodes occur mainly on the extensor side of the joints. If the nervous system is involved, it mainly shows in a clumsiness and unrest of the extremities.",
  "treatment": "A throat swab and specific blood tests can prove a Streptococcus pyogenes infection, and together with the symptoms mentioned above, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be confirmed. Therapy concentrates on fighting the Streptococcus with penicillin and on treating the inflammatory responses of joints, heart and other affected areas, most often with cortisone, or sometimes Aspirin. The treatment takes 4-6 weeks. The prognosis of rheumatic fever mainly depends on its severity and how strong the heart valves are affected. Today, rheumatic fever is a rare condition, because most infections of the upper respiratory tract are immediately treated with antibiotics.",

It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the inflammation results from the immune system attacking the body's own tissues.",
  "descriptionShort": "Rheumatoid arthritis describes an autoimmune disorder which leads to an inflammation of the joints (arthritis). The cause is still unknown but can be related to genes and the environment. Lifestyle changes and medication can help to alleviate the symptoms. In severe cases, surgery of affected joints may be needed.",
  "medicalCondition": "The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unclear. But as far as it is known, it is a disease resulting from the attack of the own immune system against the synovial, a structure of the joint. This can lead to an inflammation of every joint in the body. However, there is a typical pattern of distribution of joint inflammations. It is most commonly present in the base and middle joints of the fingers, the wrist, the base joint of the toes, the shoulder, knee and ankle. Besides genes, environmental factors, such as viruses and bacteria, are thought to play a role in causing rheumatoid arthritis. Most common the rheumatoid arthritis proceeds relapsing and chronic, which means it will never heal completely. However, some people have this disease for only a short time. The symptoms are swelling, pain, redness and stiffness in the joints. But sometimes it may also affects other organs such as the tendons, the bursae, the skin (rheumatoid nodule), the conjunctiva or even the heart and lungs. Severe forms of the disease can lead to total joint destruction. People with rheumatoid arthritis may also feel fatigued and sick. Sometimes they can develop light fever.",
  "treatment": "The treatments are aimed at relieving the pain, reducing swelling, halting joint damage, and helping patients feel better and remain active. Treatments may include: 1) lifestyle changes: keeping a good balance between rest and exercise, avoiding strain on the joints, lowering stress levels and following a healthy diet, 2) medication: This involves pain relievers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and so called biologica, which aim to reduce the autoimmune response, 3) surgery: In cases of sever joint destruction, only surgery, such as joint stiffening and artificial joint implantation, can help to reduce pain and enable sufferers to lead a more active life. Patients should visit their doctor regularly to make sure their condition is under control.",

There is sneezing as well as fever associated with it. Unlike cold, hay fever is never viral in origin.",
  "medicalCondition": "Once, an allergic patient gets exposure to the allergen, following signs and symptoms happen: Runny nose, Nasal congestion, Itchy eyes, mouth or throat, Sneezing, Cough, Dark circles around the eyes, Crease on the nasal dorsum (so-called 'allergic salute' sign caused by rubbing the nose). When the symptoms don’t improve even when the patient refrains from the allergen then he needs to consult a doctor.",
  "treatment": "The treatment strategy of allergic rhinitis looks as follows: 1. Prevention: This is the first step of treatment of allergic rhinitis and must be kept in mind. The affected person must cover his mouth while stepping out in fresh air in spring season. Activities such as dry dusting at home should not be performed. Similarly, pets must be kept away from oneself if animal dander is the cause. 2. Specific treatment: Antihistamines, these are best over-the-counter medications which help with itching and sneezing and relieve severe signs and symptoms. Best antihistamines are cetirizine and loratadine, which are nasal corticosteroids for prevention of inflammation and help in relieving a runny nose. Sodium Cromoglycate, which is in the form of sprays and is basically an inhibitor of allergic reaction. It stabilizes the mast cells and prevents serious side effects. Montelukast comes at the end when the affected person is done with the treatment and allergic rhinitis is stabilized, Montelukast works best to prevent second or further attacks. 3. Desensitization: When there are repeated attacks and no available medicine works out, then an anti-allergen injection is given which prevents from allergic reactions.",

  "medicalCondition": "The exact cause of flu-related rhinitis is unknown but professionals do know that the condition develops when blood vessels in the nose expand or dilate, filling the nasal lining with fluid and blood. This results in swollen nasal membranes and congestion. There are various triggers of flu-related rhinitis. These triggers include occupational or environmental irritants such as strong odors like perfumes, secondhand smoke, smog or dust. Chemical fumes in some occupations can cause flu-related rhinitis. Humidity or temperature changes can cause the membranes inside the nose to swell and trigger a stuffy or runny nose. A viral infection such as the flu or a cold is a common cause of the condition. Some alcoholic beverages and food such as spicy or hot foods can cause the membranes in the nose to swell, triggering a nasal congestion. Some medications including ibuprofen, aspirin, and high blood pressures medicines can also cause flu-related rhinitis. The symptoms can be constant or short. These symptoms include cough, mucus in the throat, sneezing, runny nose, and stuffy nose. Usually, flu-related rhinitis does not cause itchy throat, nose or eyes.",
  "treatment": "If rhinitis symptoms last a long time, make an appointment with a specialist to find out why. It’s seldom that the cause behind the rhinitis is something like a sinus infection or a benign tumor in the sinus cavity (polyps). Treatment depends on the cause. Rhinitis due to a cold usually clears up in few days. Nasal sprays (for no longer than 5 days) or a saline solution can be used to help. Anti-inflammatory nasal sprays (containing cortisone, for example) can provide relief for those with allergic rhinitis.",

In certain cases surgery will be required.",
  "medicalCondition": "The rotator cuff is a group of four tendons and muscles that converge around the shoulder joint at the top of the humerus.

Causes of rotator cuff rupture include 1) injuries such as a fall on one’s arm while it is stretched out or a sudden jerking motion when one tries to lift something heavy, 2) a chronic tear of the rotator cuff tendon occurs slowly over time. It is more likely when one has chronically inflamed tendons or an impingement syndrome. Swimmers, tennis players and football players have higher risk of an acute rotator cuff rupture. People with rotator cuff rupture may have symptoms such pain, weakness and tenderness, difficulty moving, snapping or crackling sound in the shoulder. Often the pain occurs during overhead work or at night when sleeping on the affected shoulder.",

To support the healing process of the injured joint the doctor may prescribe a sling or a brace to rest the arm for e few days. The painful and swollen area can be cooled with ice several times a day. In case that shoulder dislocation becomes a recurring (chronic) issue a surgery may become necessary. If ligaments have been torn or bone (mostly the glenoid) has been broken by the dislocation or if the doctors are unable to reduce the humerus, surgery will also be necessary to stabilize the joint and repair tissue damage.",

It usually affects the skin with active sebaceous glands such as the scalp, face, cleavage, axle and pubic area. The patient may scratch these skin patches and cause small injuries, which usually heal scarless.",
  "descriptionShort": "Seborrheic dermatitis is an inflammation occurring on the skin. Though seborrheic dermatitis can be a result from an infection based inflammation, it is neither dangerous nor contagious. People with seborrheic dermatitis may have itchy skin, feel uncomfortable and face cosmetic problems in the affected areas. It is usually treated by a dermatologist.",
  "medicalCondition": "The cause of seborrheic dermatitis is still unknown. However, the following conditions may be factors that can cause it: 1) genetic predisposition, 2) abnormal sebaceous glands, 3) infections caused by yeast fungus (pityrosporum ovale or malassezia furfur), 4) weak immune system 5) hormones and 6) nervous system problems. People with seborrheic dermatitis usually have slightly itchy lesions on the skin. Yellowish or white skin scales and redness are the two main signs of seborrheic dermatitis. The seborrheic dermatitis often affects the head of infants under 3 months of age (cradle cap). Seborrheic dermatitis in adults mostly occurs on the face, especially the creases around the nose and the forehead. Areas such as the ears, scalp or other “oily” areas (axle, cleavage, pubic area) are also affected commonly.",
  "treatment": "Generally speaking, people with seborrheic dermatitis may be treated with creams containing steroids, antifungal drugs or zinc. These drugs can relieve the inflammation and avoid the production of scales. For people with seborrheic dermatitis affecting the scalp, it is advised to use shampoos with anti-dandruff substances from time to time in agreement with their doctors. In general the patients should only use mild shampoos.",

  "description": "A salivary gland stone refers to a compact and hard mass usually formed by mineral salts in the salivary gland or its ducts. It may hinder the flow of the saliva and will therefore lead to pain and swelling of the affected gland. Furthermore, this condition can trigger a bacterial infection of the salivary gland.",
  "descriptionShort": "A salivary gland stone is a mass formed by mineral salts from the salivary juice inside the salivary gland. Normally people can drink more water to avoid getting salivary gland stones. Once salivary gland stones start to accumulate in the salivary gland, it is recommended to visit a doctor for a proper treatment.",
  "medicalCondition": "The salivary glands produce saliva in the mouth. However, the salivary gland stones can form because there are many different components, such as mineral salts, in saliva, which can precipitate and subsequently form a hard, chalk-like mass and block the gland. When the salivary gland is blocked, it will cause the saliva to accumulate and then result in swelling of the gland, which can be painful. Furthermore, it may lead to inflammation, especially if the gland gets infected with bacteria. There are three different kinds of salivary glands: 1) parotid glands, 2) submandibular glands, and 3) sublingual glands. Salivary gland stones occur more often in the submandibular and parotid glands. Promoting factors for the development of salivary stones are dehydration, high blood level of calcium and inflammatory diseases of the salivary gland. People with salivary gland stones often have symptoms such as problems with opening the mouth or swallowing, dry mouth, pain in the mouth or face, and swelling of the neck or face.",
  "treatment": "Normally people can drink more water to avoid getting salivary gland stones. Once salivary gland stones start to accumulate in the salivary gland, treatment is mainly aimed at the removal of these stones. The treatment may include 1) massaging the gland and attempting to manually move the stone out of the gland by pushing it out, 2) surgery in order to remove the salivary stones. Nowadays, this can be done with a minimally invasive endoscopy of the salivary gland, 3) use of shock wave lithotripsy. Shock waves are able to break the salivary stones. If the salivary gland becomes infected due to the obstruction, then medication such as antibiotics and surgery to drain or even remove the affected glands may be considered.",

  "medicalCondition": "There are several kinds of scoliosis including: 1) Idiopathic scoliosis: it can be grouped by age, for example, infantile scoliosis for children below 3 years old, juvenile scoliosis for children at age 4-10, adolescent scoliosis for children at age 11-18. 2) Congenital scoliosis: people with congenital scoliosis are born with the disease. It happens due to the abnormal development of a baby’s ribs or spine. 3) Neuromuscular scoliosis: it results from a problem of nervous system, which can affect the muscles. 4) Growth too fast: people are prone to have an abnormal curvature of spine due to a growth spurt. People with scoliosis almost have no symptoms. If there are any, they may be backache or low back pain, tired feeling in the spine, uneven hips or shoulder, and spine curves more to one side.",
  "treatment": "The treatment will depend on the specific scoliosis. For example, people with idiopathic scoliosis normally do not require treatments. However, they should go regularly to a doctor to check the condition every 6 months. For people who are still growing, the doctor may recommend a back brace to avoid the further abnormal curvature of spine. The best timing to use back braces is for people who are more than 10 years old. However, the back braces cannot work for people with neuromuscular or congenital scoliosis. For some severe cases, a surgery is needed. After a surgery, the doctor may also refer the patient to a physical therapist.",

Therefore affected persons are unable to focus one spot with both eyes at the same time. The causes include various dysfunctions in the coordination of the eye muscles and unilateral poor eyesight.",
  "descriptionShort": "A squint describes a condition when the eyes do not stand in a parallel manner and therefore cannot focus the same spot. It mainly results from poor control of the eye muscles, but could also be due to unilateral poor eyesight. A visit to an oculist is important in order to improve vision.",
  "medicalCondition": "The causes of a squint include: 1) damage or problems of the eye muscles, 2) damage or problems of the nerves which control the eye muscles, or 3) damage to an area of the brain which integrates the information to coordinate eye movement, caused, for example, by a stroke. 4) Poor sight on one eye that prevents the brain from getting an optical feedback about the actual position of the eye. In addition, a squint can also develop due to a congenital problem or general health conditions. People with a family history of a squint, refractive error such as farsightedness, and medical conditions such as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, stroke and head injuries, may have a higher risk of developing a squint. A squint can be classified on basis of direction into four types: 1) inward turning: esotropia, 2) outward turning: exotropia, 3) upward turning: hypertropia, and 4) downward turning: hypotropia. Quite recently affected persons often suffer from double vision. After a while living with a squint, the patient’s brain will suppress the information of the affected eye and therefore the affected person will barely notice anything. For children between 1 and 3 years of age, a squint is actually a dangerous condition. In this timeframe the visual area matures and a squint could lead to an irreversible and lifelong suppression of one eye (amblyopia).",
  "treatment": "The treatment of a squint can include: 1) Contact lenses and eyeglasses: it can help to adjust the vision for people with near- and farsightedness. 2) Prism lenses: it can adjust the angle of light entering the eyes and enables binocular vision despite squint. 3) Eye muscle surgery: it can correct the position or length of the eye muscles. 4) Covering the healthy eye of a child. This will force the brain to use the squinting eye and therefore prevent loss of eyesight (amblyopia).",

Nowadays in many countries there is a tiny amount of iodine supplemented in the table salt in order to prevent this problem. Besides that, there are many other factors that can cause a goitre. For example, an immune disease such as Grave’s disease or Hashimoto’s disease can affect the gland and result in a goitre. Abnormal nodules on the gland may also affect the normal function of thyroid gland and eventually lead to a goitre. Thyroid cancer and inflammation are also factors that irritate the gland and make it enlarged.

  "description": "A trigger finger results from an inflammation happening in the sheath surrounding the tendon ant the tendon of a finger itself. The inflammation will cause the affected finger to be stuck in a position because the tendon is unable to pass through its sheath (the annular ligament mostly builds the obstacle). This causes the finger to stay in its bent position until the pulling force is strong enough to tug the tendon through the obstacle. Thereby results the typically flipping straightening motion.",
  "descriptionShort": "A trigger finger is a condition which occurs when the affected finger has a restraint in straightening. The finger stays bent at the beginning of straightening and then suddenly straightens with a flipping movement. The movements are like pulling and releasing a trigger. Anti-inflammatory drugs are frequently used to treat the condition. A surgery will be necessary if the treatment does not work.",
  "medicalCondition": "The cause of a trigger finger is mainly an inflammation. Once an inflammation occurs in the tendon of a finger, it may cause swelling and the related stiffness. As a result, the affected finger will become locked and bent for a while, and then it may suddenly straighten with a snap. The movements are like pulling and releasing a trigger. And a trigger finger often happens to the thumb, middle finger and ring finger but every finger can be affected. If the condition is severe, then the affected finger may even stay in the bent position and be unable to straighten ever again. The risks of getting a trigger finger are related to the working environment, lifestyle and any other diseases. For example, people who need to repeat actions like clicking, gripping and typing during work are more likely to have the problem. Besides, diseases such as arthritis and diabetes can also increase the risk. People with a trigger finger may experience symptoms not only such as a finger stuck like pulling a trigger, but they may also feel nodules, tenderness, stiffness and pain at the affected area.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of a trigger finger is to reduce the inflammation and swelling. Treatments often include medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs can help to relieve the inflammation as well as the pain. If the treatment does not work, a local injection with steroid or a surgery will be necessary. The goal of surgery is to remove the bottleneck (mostly through a cut of the A1 annular ligament) so the tendon is able to slide smoothly again.",

Bladder incontinence in women can result from birth giving, a weak pelvic floor, prolapse of the uterus, prolapse of the bladder or low estrogen levels. In men it can be caused by enlargement of the prostate or narrowing of the urethra. Other possible causes include an infection, inherited deformity or neurological disease of the bladder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, paraplegia, an operation, or medication. There is also stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence (which comprises 70% of all cases), in which urine involuntarily passes when there is an increase in pressure on the abdomen, for example during coughing or when lifting heavy objects. Stress incontinence is the result of a weak pelvic floor. In contrast, urge incontinence (about 10-20% of all cases of urinary incontinence) causes an urgency to urinate and the release of urine in small amounts. Disruptions to neurological control are responsible for urge incontinence, excitability of the bladder muscles, and stimulated state of the bladder or urethra.",
  "descriptionShort": "Involuntary urination or urinary incontinence occurs when a person is unable to hold intentionally urine in the bladder and decide when he should empty the bladder. This condition affects a high number of people around the world and the gravity ranges from leaking occasionally urine when a person sneezes or coughs to having an urgent need to empty the bladder. This need is so strong and sudden that the person does not have time to reach a toilet.",
  "medicalCondition": "Bladder incontinence is a common condition in older women. 30% of women over 65 are affected by it. Stress incontinence can cause an unwanted need to urinate in the following situations: coughing, sneezing, straining, sex, lifting heavy items or other similar physical exercise. Urge incontinence presents with the occurrence of a sudden, intense urge to urinate even when the bladder is mostly empty, which results in frequent urination with small amounts and occasional lower abdomen pains before urge to urinate develops.",
  "treatment": "Pelvic Floor Exercise and behavior modification through regulation of the drinking quantity and toilet training can be an initial training in case of stress incontinence. If this is unsuccessful, medication or surgical implantation of a tape around the urethra can be considered. In case of urge incontinence, different medications can be applied. Botox injections into the bladder may also lead to the desired results.",

Kidney stones are a common cause of pain in the groin, flank, or abdomen, and can cause blood in the urine. Kidney stones occur in 1 out of 20 persons during their lifetime. These stones vary considerably in size from small stones like gravel to big staghorn calculi.",
  "descriptionShort": "Urinary stones are stones formed in the renal pelvis as kidney stone and then become stuck in the urinary tract. Urinary stones can cause severe, cramping pain.",
  "medicalCondition": "When kidney stones reach the urinary tract and get stuck (where they are called urinary stones) they can produce severe cramping pain (called renal colic), which can radiate out from flanks to belly or groin. Movement of the stones along the urinary tract lead to small injuries of the mucus membrane in the urinary tract, which causes bleeding and can turn urine light pink.",
  "treatment": "Treatment consists of reducing pain with medication and observing the patient. Small urinary stones generally flow out on their own and can be “forced” out with the urine. Larger stones, however, need to be broken up with medication, shattered with sound waves, or removed with a ureteroscope. Removal is necessary, as kidney stones that clog up the ureter can cause urine stagnation, leading to infection in the upper urinary tract (see the article on pyelonephritis), which can damage the kidneys.",

For first aid it is always advised to flush the affected skin with large amount of cold and clean water for about 5-10 minutes. If case of high-grade or large-area burns, an immediate medical treatment is necessary.",
  "medicalCondition": "According to the severity of a burn, the injury can be classified in to three different levels. Skin is categorized in three layers: the superficial layer is called epidermis, the middle layer is the dermis, and the deepest layer is called hypodermis. A first-degree burn means that the damage limited on the superficial layer of skin (epidermis). A second-degree burn means the damage not only damages the first layer of skin (epidermis), but also affects the second layer of skin (dermis). And a third-degree burn is a severe condition, which reaches into the deepest layer (hypodermis). Furthermore, in this level even the muscles, nerves and blood vessels can be damaged. After all, a burn causes mainly pain. Besides, swelling, redness and blisters occur. Possible complications are infection, cardiovascular shock due to dehydration, scars and even death.",
  "treatment": "Whenever a burn is diagnosed, the following hints should be followed: To flush injured tissue with large amount of clean and cold water for at least 5 minutes, to remove the clothes covering the affected skin, to soak the affected skin into clean and cold water, to cover the affected skin with a clean towel, and to seek immediate medical treatment. If a large area of skin is burned, it may be important to drink lots of water to avoid rapid dehydration. For mild burns with opened skin, tropical antibiotic ointment can help to avoid a further infection. However, severe burns may need intensive medical care. For example, wound cleaning, blood or fluid transfusion, removal of the dead skin and surgical replacement of the skin tissue. The development of scars can cause impairments that will make further physical and occupational therapy necessary.",

  "description": "Heart failure is a syndrome that can be caused by various conditions. Eventually, the heart is weakened up to a point where it can’t pump enough blood through the systemic circulation (left heart failure) or the lungs (right heart failure). So therefore it doesn't mean that it has stopped working, instead the pumping of blood is weaker than normal. The disorders which lead to a heart failure cannot all completely be healed, however the right treatment plan can help to alleviate the symptoms and signs of a heart failure. This in turn can help the patient to live longer. With heart failure, blood moves at a slower rate through the heart and body, triggering an increase of the pressure in the heart. The result is that the heart cannot pump enough nutrients and oxygen to meet the body's needs. Heart failure is the major cause of hospitalization in people older than age 65.",
  "descriptionShort": "Heart failure, known sometimes as congestive heart failure, describes the result of a condition when the heart muscle cannot pump a sufficient amount of blood through the body. Some conditions, such as high blood pressure or narrowed arteries in the heart gradually lead the heart to become too stiff or weak to fill completely and pump efficiently.",
  "medicalCondition": "A left heart failure causes difficulty in breathing and coughing, first during physical strain, eventually also in an idle state. If the condition progresses further, the patient might only be able to breathe properly while sitting down or with propped-up arms. Other symptoms of left heart failure are reduced performance, weakness and memory impairment. Symptoms of right heart failure include swollen ankles, weight gain and sometimes a painful liver enlargement. Both forms of heart failure cause the patient to feel the need to go to the toilet frequently at night and heart palpitations.",
  "treatment": "There are numerous options available to treat this condition. The first steps include tight control over the lifestyle and medications of the patient to introduce suitable mesaures in addition to a careful monitoring. More advanced options of treatment can be offered by doctors specializing in the treatment of heart failure as the condition evolves. The objective of the treatment is to decrease the progression of the disease, to alleviate symptoms, and to enhance quality of life as unfortunately there is no complete cure for heart failure. The patient and his doctor can determine together the best option of treatment for him. It is recommended to talk to a general practitioner or a cardiologist.",

During the changes of position, if the body is not able to regulate the blood pressure, it may result in lowering of blood pressure (hypotension) or even loss of consciousness (syncope).",
  "descriptionShort": "Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden decrease of blood pressure due to the effect of gravity during change of position. Orthostatic hypotension is the result of various diseases affecting the ability for blood pressure regulation. It is recommended that the affected person consults a doctor to clarify the cause and get proper treatment if there is any related problem.",
  "medicalCondition": "The causes of an orthostatic hypotension are various. However, there are some common factors including the following: 1) Dehydration may result in a loss of blood volume, and easily lead to orthostatic hypotension. 2) Heart problems will make it more difficult for the heart to suddenly increase cardiac output and therefore lead to hypotension, especially during changing of position. 3) Endocrine problems, such as diabetes and adrenal insufficiency, may, directly or due to damage on the nerves, disturb the regulation of blood pressure. 4) Nervous system diseases may also disrupt the normal regulation of blood pressure, as such count Parkinson’s disease, amyloidosis and dementia. 5) Some older people may experience orthostatic hypotension after eating meals due to the distribution of blood to digestive organs. Typical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are dizziness, impaired vision (“seeing stars”) and fainting (syncope).",
  "treatment": "Avoiding a sudden change of position and raising slowly can prevent the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. The treatment of orthostatic hypotension will depend on the causes. For example, in the case where the cause of orthostatic syncope is dehydration, it is usually treated by the administration of fluids and electrolytes. If the orthostatic hypotension is caused by certain diseases, then the underlying disease should be resolved. Orthostatic hypotension can cause serious problems, especially in the elderly. Therefore, it is necessary to visit a doctor to find the cause and to undergo a proper treatment.",

However, the most common cause of gait abnormality is old age. For elder people, brain degenerative or neurological disease like Parkinson’s disease can also lead to gait abnormality. So far, gait abnormality can be classified into several types: 1) Propulsive gait: it is a stiff and stooped posture. People with propulsive gait may walk with neck and head bent forward. 2) Scissors gait: it is a condition when people have the scissor-shaped legs and scissor-like walking patterns. 3) Spastic gait: it is a foot-dragging and stiff walking pattern, which is caused by an abnormal and long muscle contraction. 4) Steppage gait: it is also called drop foot gait that describes when the foot drops, the toes will point down and touch the floor first. 5) Waddling gait: it is a duck-like walk.",
  "treatment": "The treatments of gait abnormality will depend on the causes. Once the doctor finds the underlying disease that causes gait abnormality, the treatment will be focus on the disease.

  "description": "The facial nerve (nervus facialis) controls the movement of facial muscles. Once the facial nerve, its branches or nuclei are injured or damaged, the person is unable to control the facial muscles and suffer therefore from facial paralysis.",
  "descriptionShort": "A facial paralysis describes a condition when people cannot move their facial muscles voluntarily. It normally affects only one side of the face. The causes of facial paralysis are various. It is important to visit a neurologist in order to investigate the underlying cause and to get a proper treatment.",
  "medicalCondition": "The cause of a facial paralysis is mainly due to inflammation or injury of the facial nerves. There are many factors that can result in the damage of facial nerves. For example: infections by bacteria and virus, damage caused during surgery, neurological diseases, facial traumas and fractures, and brain traumas. It can also be caused by damage to the nuclei of the facial nerve in the brain, for example due to a stroke. However there are plenty of possible causes, in the most common facial paralysis, the idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (Bell’s palsy), one is unable to identify a specific cause. Additionally, facial paralysis can also be caused by a congenital problem, such as an abnormal development of facial nerves or muscles, compression of the facial nerve in the womb or some other genetic problem. People with facial paralysis cannot move the facial muscles voluntarily. Mostly only one side of the face is affected, which will render the face asymmetrical. Depending on the localization, disorders in taste and hearing could also occur.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of facial paralysis will depend on its cause. It is important to determine the underlying problem and, if possible, to treat it. However, the facial palsy can often not be treated specifically. Nevertheless it mostly improves or heals spontaneously. This spontaneous healing process will often need much time. Therapies such as physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy will help to rehabilitate the muscles and nerves directed and quicker. In severe cases, surgery will be necessary to improve the condition, for example to correct hanging eyelids.",

  "description": "Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that commonly occurs in developing countries. The infection can remain undetected (latent) as it runs its course, which means that infected persons had contact with tuberculosis bacteria, but the lungs remain unaffected. On the other hand, if a patient infected with tuberculosis bacteria suffers from an lung attack, then it’s an active case of tuberculosis or primary tuberculosis. An normal immune system is capable of keeping the bacteria in check and preventing its spread. The bacteria can survive for years in the lungs and spread at a later point in time when the immune system is weakened. This would be a case of postprimary tuberculosis. It doesn’t necessarily have to occur in the lungs, but most of the time postprimary tuberculosis will manifest in the lungs.",
  "descriptionShort": "An infection from tuberculosis bacteria comes after close contact with a person that is already carrying the bacteria. Persons with intact immune systems rarely become ill. However, persons with a compromised immune system (drug addicted, alcoholic, undernourished, diabetic, or malignant illness) have a higher risk of contracting tuberculosis. It affects the lungs and is lethal if left untreated.",
  "medicalCondition": "One third of the world population is infected with tuberculosis bacteria, of which 10% will come down with a case of active tuberculosis in the course of their lives. Especially in developing countries, where HIV infections are common, tuberculosis represents a major health issue. The infected person may be symptom-free or may suffer from fever, weight loss, night sweats, loss of energy, coughing, sputum, shortness of breath, chest pains or coughing blood.",
  "treatment": "Primary infections left untreated can develop complications in the course of the disease. Bacteria can spread to various organs, such as the lungs, brain and spinal cord, liver, spleen, and kidneys and the functions of these organs can be compromised. For this reason, every active case of tuberculosis needs to be treated with antibiotics. Because tuberculosis bacteria slowly divide, treatment is performed over a long period of time, usually for half a year. Besides that, during the treatmet of tuberculosis, the patient should be isolated.",

Allergic rhinitis: In this case, the body’s own immune system will build antibodies against certain substances (allergens) that are normally harmless.

Examples of allergic rhinitis include: 1) Seasonal allergic rhinitis, which often results from pollen of trees and herbs that are spread in the air when the plant is blooming. This form of rhinitis is also known as hay fever. 2) Perennial allergic rhinitis, which often results from mold, dust mites and dander of animals.

Meanwhile, pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication, muscle relaxants can also help to relieve the symptoms and give a breakthrough in the vicious circle. Massage can help the blood flow to the neck muscle and loosen the tight muscles. Heat therapy can also achieve this purpose. Immediately after damaging the muscles it is recommended to cool the area to prevent inflammation. Afterwards warming is advantageous to increase blood flow and thereby accelerate healing.

  "medicalCondition": "The causes of nerve root irritation in cervical spine can be various, for example: 1) herniation of the cervical discs can compress and irritate the nerve root, 2) stenosis caused by bone spurs, arthritis and other degenerative processes of the spine can narrow the intervertebral foramina, the exit where the spinal nerves leave the spine canal, and therefore lead to compression of the nerve root: the condition happens mostly with elderly persons, 3) nerve root irritation caused by certain spinal injuries and traumas: the condition occurs in young people and can result in disc rupture, 4) Inflammations of the nerve root due to an Infection, a tumor or bleeding in the respective area. Normally a nerve root irritation of the cervical spine will cause symptoms such as pain of the upper extremities i.e. the neck, the shoulders, arms, hands, fingers and even chest and upper back. Additionally, symptoms such as muscle weakness, tingling and loss of sensation in the upper extremities are also common. The location of these symptoms depends on which nerve root is affected.",
  "treatment": "An irritation of the cervical root nerve can mostly be confirmed after an image study has been performed. The treatments include medication, physical therapy and surgery. Medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers can relieve the symptoms. Physical therapy can help regain muscle strength as well as reduce pain.

  "medicalCondition": "An eating disorder often begins in the presence of abnormal dietary habits. It is more likely to occur in women than in men. There are three main groups of eating disorders. The first one is anorexia nervosa: This is a condition when people, who have a critically low BMI (body mass index), deliberately do not want to take enough food. People with anorexia nervosa have a so called disturbance of body image, which means they feel fat although they actually may be too thin. A problem in patients with anorexia nervosa is the lack of insight for this illness. The second type of eating disorder is bulimia nervosa. This condition makes people, who generally eat few, suffer from massive attacks of food craving that will make them eat unusually large amounts of food. After the excessive intake of food, they may feel guilty and will try to lose the calories. Common methods are self-induced vomiting, laxatives and excessive sport. This behavior is called purging. Persons with bulimia may have normal body weight. The third type of eating disorder is called binge eating: This is a condition when people are tending to have attacks with out-of-control eating. Affected persons feel unable to control the urge to eat and may not even realize their behavior. People with binge eating disorders often have the problem of obesity.",

  "descriptionShort": "Esophageal varices are abnormally enlarged veins in the lower part of the esophagus. This condition is often related to a liver disease. The varices reach into the esophageal lumen and are therefore vulnerable to injuries. This would cause massive bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, which necessitates immediate medical treatment.",
  "medicalCondition": "Esophageal varices develop due to stowage of blood in the portal vein system (portal hypertension). Whenever the regular blood flow through the liver is prevented, the blood will seek a collateral circulation. The veins of the esophagus provide such a collateral circulation but, if overused, will enlarge and become esophageal varices. The underlying cause of portal hypertension, and therefore of esophageal varices, are mostly liver-related problems, for example, more than forty percent of people with esophageal varices have liver cirrhosis. Liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, infection of the liver and fatty liver can all end into cirrhosis. In addition, thrombosis of the portal vein is also a common reason. Thrombosis of the portal vein is a condition when there is a blood clot stuck in the portal vein and it thereby causes high pressure in the vein which then leads to esophageal varices. Generally speaking, all persons with hypertension of the portal vein, disregarded which cause it has, are at a high risk of getting the disease. People with esophageal varices mostly have mild symptoms such as abdominal pain or dysphagia. Guiding findings are other stigmas of portal hypertension such as ascites, specific skin marks and an enlargement of the spleen. A rupture of an esophageal varices will result in massive inner bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract. This may lead to blood vomiting and problems with circulation that have high mortality.",
  "treatment": "The therapy of esophageal varices contains the treatment of the underlying cause, mostly the treatment of portal hypertension with medications or an artificial shunt (TIPS). In order to prevent rupture of the veins and the related fatal complications, the varices may be treated endoscopically by band ligation or sclerotherapy. If the varices rupture and start bleeding, an immediate intensive care and endoscopic intervention, in order to stop the bleeding, will be needed.",

To determine if surgery is necessary a doctor will detect the location of the jaw fracture by x-ray or computed tomography. Meanwhile, treatment will include medications to relieve pain and swelling and antibiotics.",
  "medicalCondition": "The causes of a jaw fracture are mostly accidents such as car or motorcycle accidents, falling from a height or being attacked by people or injured by certain objects. A jaw fracture can happen either to the lower jaw (mandible, mandibular bones) or the upper jaw (maxilla, facial bones). When a person has a jaw fracture, pain on the face, numbness of the lips, difficulty in opening or closing the mouth, swelling and bruise in the affected areas is experienced. Often the teeth don’t fit together perfectly.",
  "treatment": "The treatment for a jaw fracture may be conservative or operative. If the jaw fracture is mild, then rest and avoiding using the injured part is important. This often includes a liquid diet. Medications such as pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics may also be used to reduce the symptoms and prevent an infection. Sometimes it may be necessary to temporarily fix the upper and lower jaw together with a splint until the fracture has healed. For severe cases, surgery is necessary to realign and repair the broken areas with metal plates and screws.",

Besides, abuse of drugs and medications, or the toxicity of heavy metal can also result in an abnormal metabolism and lead to a brain dysfunction. The symptoms of a metabolic encephalopathy mostly occur acutely. People normally suffer from symptoms of impairment of consciousness like concentration disorders, delirium and loss of consciousness. However, this disease is reversible and curable as long as the treatment is early enough.

Congenital diseases of the heart valves often occur in the pulmonary valve and aortic valve, and acquired diseases of the heart valves often involve the aortic valve and mitral valve. Generally speaking, there are three common types of dysfunction of a heart valve: regurgitation, atresia and stenosis. Regurgitation occurs when the valves are unable to close adequately, and this leads to a flowing back of blood on every heartbeat. Stenosis means that the valves do not open regularly and therefore narrow the blood canal. This occurs when the valves thicken and become stiffer. Atresia means, that the channel where the valves are located is abnormally narrow and prevents blood flowing through. An often found hint for a disease of the heart valve is a heart murmur (heart sound). Depending on which valves are affected, patients may develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations or swollen legs.",

Normally some women with primary dysmenorrhea may feel pain before menstruation starts, and the pain may become worse when the level of prostaglandin further increases during menstruation. 2) Secondary dysmenorrhea: This type of dysmenorrhea firstly appears anytime in life. There are mostly underlying disorders of the female reproductive system such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids or a myoma that cause menstrual pain. The pain caused by secondary dysmenorrhea is usually also worst during menstruation but it will not necessarily improve after the period of menstruation.

A diverticulitis develops when a preexisting diverticulum gets obstructed and bacteria, which normally live in high numbers in the large intestine, start to breed uncontrolled in the diverticulum and therefore lead to an inflammation. The diverticulum itself is an asymptomatic evagination of the wall of the large intestine. The formation of diverticulum is associated with a weakened wall of large intestine and high pressure inside the large intestine. The obstruction of the diverticulum with a small amount of stool may lead to inflammation and infection. A diverticulitis can be classified in either closed (uncomplicated), occultly perforated or openly perforated. An openly perforated diverticulitis means that infectious pus is running out of the diverticulum in the peritoneal space. People with diverticulitis may have symptoms such as pain and tenderness in abdomen (typically in the left lower abdomen), bloating, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, and even blood in the stool.",
  "treatment": "Balanced and high-fiber diets can help to decrease the risks of getting diverticulum and therefore diverticulitis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is treated with antibiotics. Besides, affected people need to fast for several days. If the diverticulitis is openly perforated or becomes a recurring condition, surgery will be necessary. The aim of surgery is to remove the affected parts of the large intestine.",

The common risks include trauma to the abdomen and abdominal surgery. A very common cause of peritonitis is an appendicitis. A peritonitis is always a life-threatening condition. With peritonitis symptoms like fever, chills, excessive fatigue, less urination, nausea and vomiting, rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath may appear. Because the peritoneum is very sensitive, patients suffer from debilitating abdominal pain, which only remits in rest with cocked legs.",

  "medicalCondition": "The primary cause of femoroacetabular impingement is an abnormal shape of the femoral head or acetabulum. It is commonly classified into 3 forms including 1) cam impingement: this is a deformity of the ball-like shape of the femoral head. If the head is not shaped normally, the abnormal part of the head may jam in the socket (acetabulum) when the hip is bent, 2) pincer impingement: This is a deformity of the acetabulum. If the front rim of the acetabulum protrudes too far, the neck of the femur may collide with the rim of the acetabulum during normal hip movement, 3) mixed impingement: this is a deformity resulting in a combination of cam and pincer impingement. People with FAI may have symptoms such as pain in the groin or gluteal area. The symptoms can typically be triggered by climbing stairs, walking uphill and sitting for longer time. Commonly affected are children and adults who do a lot of sports.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of FAI may include either conservative or surgical treatment. Conservative treatments include 1) activity changes: avoiding activities that cause symptoms, 2) non-steroid anti-inflammation medication: they reduce the inflammation and pain, 3) physical therapy: this may help relieve stress on the injured labrum or cartilage. If the symptoms cannot be relieved by nonsurgical treatment, early surgical treatment should be considered.

The structure of the pelvis is like a ring with bones situated between the legs and the spine at the lower part of the trunk. Such structure means that when a fracture occurs in a part of it, another part is also affected with injury to ligaments or a fracture. There are numerous common patterns of pelvic fracture. Each pattern is influenced by the direction of the fracture and the intensity of the force behind the fracture. Since the pelvis is close to important organs and blood vessels, fractures that occur in this structure can cause important damages and extensive bleeding which necessitates urgent care.",
  "descriptionShort": "A pelvic fracture is a disruption of the bony structures, which happens in the pelvis. However, pelvic fractures can be caused by many reasons, but most pelvic fractures result from high-energy forces such as a motorbike accident or fall from a height. An immediate medical treatment is necessary when pelvic fractures happen.",
  "medicalCondition": "The causes of pelvic fractures include: 1) Avulsion fracture: these fractures usually occur when there is a sudden muscle contraction happening. Some pieces of pelvic bones will be torn away by the contractions of muscles. 2) Osteoporosis: elder people with osteoporosis have higher risks of getting pelvic fractures. Osteoporosis can result in the fractures because of the weakened bony structure. However, it will not damage the whole structure of the pelvic ring, but certain weak parts of the pelvic bones. 3) High-energy forces: this is the most common reason of getting pelvic fractures. For example, car accidents, a sudden high-energy force or fall from a height. The type of pelvic fracture can be very dangerous. It is very important to seek a medical treatment immediately. The common symptoms include pain, swelling and bruise of the pelvis.",
  "treatment": "The treatments of pelvic fractures depend on the causes and the severity of the damage determines the care for a pelvic fracture. Fractures from low energy can be handled often with conservative treatment. The avulsion fracture may heal spontaneously, but the patient will need to use a walker to avoid too much stress on the pelvis. For some severe pelvic fractures caused by high energy impact, such as fractures caused by accidents, a surgery is usually necessary because this kind of fracture often is accompanied by extensive bleeding and surgery will also be needed in order to rebuild the pelvis with the objective to restore stability that will enable the patients to restart their regular activities. Besides, medication such as pain reliever can help to relieve the discomforts.",

Hyperparathyroidism occurs when there is too much parathyroid hormone produced, which results in high level of calcium in the blood.",

  "medicalCondition": "Hyperparathyroidism can be classified in three different types according to its cause. 1) primary hyperparathyroidism: It is caused by an hyperplasia (abnormal mass) or a tumor in the parathyroid gland that produces parathyroid hormones autonomically. Women and people with family history will have higher risks of getting this problem. 2.) secondary hyperparathyroidism: It is the result of other medical conditions such as kidney failure, disorders of liver or gut function, vitamin D deficiency and rickets. 3) tertiary hyperparathyroidism: it develops after years of a secondary hyperparathyroidism. The intake of lithium, a common medication for psychiatric disorders, can have a side effect that looks similar to a primary hyperparathyroidism. People with hyperparathyroidism usually have symptoms like pain in bones, vulnerability for fractures, increased amount of urine, kidney and bladder stones, fatigue and loss of appetite.",
  "treatment": "Treatments of hyperparathyroidism will depend on the causes. The high blood level of calcium and parathyroid hormone can be adjusted by low calcium and low phosphate diet and with medications such as calcitriol and cinacalcet. Drinking enough water can prevent the development of kidney stones. The degradation of bone mass can be reduced with medications like bisphosphonates and, for women, estrogen-like substances. Besides, regular exercise can strengthen the bones. When the hyperparathyroidism is caused by a medical condition, then the treatment is aimed at treating the underlying disease. In case of hyperplasia or a benign tumor, surgery will be foreseen. If the hyperparathyroidism is caused by cancer, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary.",

More probable seems that small injuries (micro traumata) in the z-line of the muscular fibrils are responsible for muscle soreness. Due to these injuries the muscle cells start to swell and to build inflammatory substances. Because there are no nerve endings in a muscle fiber, the injury cannot be felt at the time of their incidence.

  "description": "Neuralgia is pain of the nerve, which often occurs suddenly and can be severe. It is characterized as electrifying, sharp or even burning pain. The pain occurs in the area supplied by damaged nerves. Damage of the nerve can happen anywhere in the human body, however, the most common places include the face and neck.",
  "descriptionShort": "Neuralgia describes a shooting and shocking pain that develops due to damaged or irritated nerves and is located in the area supplied by the affected nerves. The treatment of neuralgia will focus on pain relief. When a person experiences similar problems as described here, it is important to visit a neurologist for further investigation.",
  "medicalCondition": "The cause of neuralgia is mainly due to nerve damage. The nerve fibers are protected by a myelin sheath. If the myelin sheath is damaged, it may result in nerve pain. Besides, also damage on the nerve fiber itself or circulatory disorders of a nerve can lead to neuralgia. There are many factors that can result in damage of the nerve, including 1) old age, 2) infection, 3) multiple sclerosis, 4) pressure on the nerves (for example herniated disks or carpal tunnel syndrome), 5) diabetes, 6) chronic renal disease, 7) porphyria, 8) trauma, 9) chemical irritation and the like. The most common neuralgias are the following: 1) Postherpetic neuralgia: it results from shingles and may be located anywhere over the body. 2) Trigeminal neuralgia: it is caused by damage of the trigeminal nerve, which goes from the brain to the face. 3) Glossopharyngeal neuralgia: damage of the glossopharyngeal nerve may produce pain in throat and neck.",
  "treatment": "The treatments of neuralgia may include 1) surgery which can relieve the pressure on the nerve, 2) control of blood sugar, 3) physical therapy and 4) medications. The common medications include anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen, anti-depressant drugs such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, and topical ointments with capsaicin. For people with severe pain, anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine and narcotic pain medications such as opioids may be used. If the pain cannot be controlled with these medications, the last option is local anesthesia or electrical nerve stimulation.",

RICE stands for rest, ice, compress and elevate the affected area to relieve the discomfort. However, treatments such as medications, physical therapy or even surgery are common for tendinitis.",
  "medicalCondition": "The causes of tendinitis are varied. For example, tendinitis can occur as a result of injury or overuse of tendon. It also can occur under the situation of tendon degeneration, which may result in the loss of elasticity and then lead to tendinitis. In addition, systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, can lead to tendinitis, too. Tendinitis can occur in any tendon. The common affected sites include: 1) elbow, 2) heel such as Achilles tendinitis, 3) shoulder, and 4) wrist. People with tendinitis usually feel redness, swelling, warmth and pain along a tendon near a joint, and the symptoms will get worse during movement or activity.",
  "treatment": "The treatments of tendinitis include RICE, medications, physical therapy or even a surgery. RICE refers to rest, to ice, to compress and to elevate the affected areas. Medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and cortisone injection can be used to reduce the inflammation and pain. Sometimes platelet-rich plasma can help to heal the inflamed tendon. If necessary, surgery will also be considered.",

Inherited iron storage disease (primary hemochromatosis) is a genetic disease, so people with a family history have higher risk of getting it. In this type a genetic mutation leads to excessive resorption of iron in the small intestine. The acquired iron storage disease (secondary hemochromatosis) is caused by other diseases or events such as hemolytic anemia, liver diseases and frequent blood transfusion. Lastly, iron storage disease of the newborn (neonatal hemochromatosis) is a rare version and leads often to a severe liver disease. Patients with an iron storage disease may have a great variety of symptoms due to the different organs involved. Most common are liver enlargement and damage, diabetes, skin color change and joint pain. Less common symptoms are spleen enlargement, rhythm disorder of the heart, fatigue and weakness. Untreated, it can permanently damage the affected organs.",

Sometime sun-related keratosis can turn into skin cancers. It is important to do the self-examinations daily. If there is any suspicious abnormality of the skin, please consult a dermatologist.",
  "medicalCondition": "The sun-related keratosis often happen to the skin of the face, scalp, ears, backs of the hands and forearms, which are thought to be often exposed to the sun. However, sun-related keratosis can still happen to any part of skin. The size of sun-related keratosis is usually less than one inch and the appearance of sun-related keratosis is often scaly and with the color of pink, red or brown. The affected skin may be rough to touch and sensitive. Later they can even become hard and wart. After all, the affected areas are normally easier to feel than to see in the beginning.",
  "treatment": "The treatments of sun-related keratosis include: 1) electrical cautery, 2) using electricity in order to destroy remaining cells and scraping away the lesion, 3) cutting out the tumor if there is any, 4) freezing or cryotherapy to kill the cells. If the affected area is large, then a laser treatment, chemical peels, or skin cream may be indicated.",

In diabetes patients factors like taking too much diabetes medication, skipping meals, eating less than normal, or excessive exercising are common causes that lead to a hypoglycemia. Besides, alcohol consumption, illness, insulin overproduction (due to a tumor), or other endocrine dysfunctions can lead to low blood sugar levels. Without enough glucose, the body cannot perform its normal function. Normally it is defined as hypoglycemia when the blood sugar level drops below 70 mg/dl. The common symptoms include blurry vision, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, pale skin, headache, hunger, shaking, sweating, and finally even loss of consciousness. A big problem is that patients will feel these symptoms very late or misconstrue them and therefore be unable to consume some sugar before the loss of consciousness occurs.",
  "treatment": "In acute phase the intake of glucose has highest priority. Either by consuming sugar containing drinks and food or, in case of lost consciousness, by an infusion. Further treatments of hypoglycemia depend on its causes. For example, if the medications caused hypoglycemia, then the doctor will adjust the dose. If one has a certain tumor such as pancreas tumor, it will be treated by surgical removal. If one has diabetes, the doctor’s prescription should be followed and the blood sugar should be checked regularly. If none of the causes apply, the lifestyle may be the cause for the hypoglycemia. In case of hypoglycemia consulting a doctor for a proper treatment way is recommended.",

People with narcolepsy may have problems like excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy. The excessive daytime sleepiness can result in sudden sleep attacks, which may last from some seconds to minutes, even when persons had enough sleep during night. Narcolepsy can occur at any age.",

  "medicalCondition": "The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown. Some researches show that narcolepsy may be related to low levels of hypocretin (orexin), which is neurotransmitter in the brain. This may be the reason for the deregulation of the sleep-wake cycles. The low concentration of hypocretin is thought to be associated with a loss of brain cells that produce hypocretin due to some autoimmune reactions. Whether other factors such as vaccinations, a trauma or injury to the brain, tumors in the brain, stress, an irregular sleep schedule, and abuse of medications or any other damage to the brain can result in narcolepsy, is not finally proven. The common symptoms include extreme daytime sleepiness (sleep attacks despite sufficient amount of sleep), cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone while retaining consciousness, triggered by a emotional stimulus such as joy or fright), hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations directly after awakening), as well as sleep paralysis (inability to move directly after awakening while fully conscious).",

Individually assessed strategies like daily sleeping episodes or the avoidance of certain situations will help to handle the disease. In addition, medications might be used for the treatment of narcolepsy, for example, 1) stimulant medicines, such as methylphenidate or modafenil, can help to stay awake during the day, 2) antidepressant medicines can help to reduce cataplexy, sleep paralysis and even hallucinations, 3) sodium oxybate can also help to control day time sleepiness and cataplexy.

But acquired causes like rheumatic fever, endocarditis, degenerative aortic valve diseases (aortic sclerosis), trauma and surgery are the most common causes of valvular dysfunctions and aortic regurgitation. 2) Aorta abnormalities: expansion of the aorta may also lead to an insufficient closure of the aortic valves and cause reverse blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle. Therefore an aortic sclerosis, connective tissue diseases such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a dissection of the aorta may also result in aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can occur either acute or chronic. Acute aortic regurgitation can manifest with the sudden appearance of significant symptoms such as pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock and heart failure. Chronic aortic regurgitation normally happens gradually and can lead to an enlargement of the heart and end in a heart failure. The symptoms of chronic aortic regurgitation are gradually increasing shortness of breath, palpitations, pressure on the chest and loss of physical resilience.",
  "treatment": "Minor asymptomatic forms do not need any treatment but a regular check-up. Treatments of aortic regurgitation include: 1) medication: vasodilators (ACE-inhibitors) can help to improve the ejection fraction of the heart, lower the aortic pressure and reduce reverse blood flow. Antibiotics may be used if there is an endocarditis. 2) Surgical intervention in order to repair the aortic valves or the aorta will be considered in severe cases.",

  "description": "The esophagus is a long and hollow tube that connects the throat and stomach together, and its function is to transport food into the stomach. The esophagus is made of smooth muscles, which transport the food with peristaltic waves, and an upper and lower sphincter, which close the end of the esophagus if necessary. A dysfunction of the esophagus results from either abnormal muscular contractions of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal function of the upper or lower sphincter.",
  "descriptionShort": "A dysfunction of the esophagus describes several conditions in which the esophagus cannot function normally. For example, gastroesophageal reflux is one of the common results of a dysfunction of the esophagus. It is recommended to visit a gastroenterologist for a further check if there are any related symptoms.",
  "medicalCondition": "The causes of a dysfunction of the esophagus could either be an abnormal contraction of the smooth esophagus muscles or abnormal functioning of the upper or lower sphincter. 1) Dysfunction of the upper parts of the esophagus often results from an excessive muscular contraction of the esophagus (esophagus spasm), which leads to difficulty in swallowing and drinking. Typical symptoms of esophageal spasm are globus sensation in the throat, pain in the chest and regurgitation of food. 2) Dysfunctions of the lower esophagus can result from either a high or a low muscular contraction of the esophagus and its lower sphincter. If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too strong, while the peristaltic smooth muscle waves are too weak, it will prevent the food from passing into the stomach, so it gets stuck in the esophagus (achalasia). Typical symptoms are problems with swallowing, pain in the chest and upper abdomen and regurgitation of food. 3.) If the contraction of the lower sphincter is too weak, it may lead to a flow back of acidic gastric contents into the esophagus, which causes damage on the esophageal mucosa. This is a common problem that is referred to as gastroesophageal reflux. People with gastroesophageal reflux may have symptoms like heartburn, chest pain, painful swallowing or coughing at night. The typical symptom of heartburn means a painful burning sensation in the upper abdomen or the chest, which worsens after eating and at night while lying horizontally.",
  "treatment": "The treatments of a dysfunction of esophagus include medications and rarely a surgery. The treatment will depend on the specific problem. For example, medication such as calcium channel blockers can help to relax the muscles of the esophagus when the dysfunction is caused by intense muscular contractions. And if the dysfunction is caused by weak muscular contractions of the esophagus, which causes the gastroesophageal reflux, it is often treated by medication such as antacids. However, in some severe cases, surgery to repair the function of the esophagus is necessary.",

Other rarer tumors are producing hormones and tend to be less malignant. 4) liver tumors: Most of them are actually metastases. A tumor originated in the liver is known as hepatocellular carcinoma 5) gall bladder tumors: they are rare and usually start in the interior layer of the gall bladder, and most of them are adenocarcinoma. The common symptoms of these gastrointestinal tumors include pain when swallowing, nausea, vomiting, anemia, tiredness, pain or swelling of the abdomen. An alarming symptom is bloody or pitch-black vomiting.",

If the fracture is caused by a disease, then besides the fracture, the underlying disease should also be treated. If it is caused by an accident, it is important to avoid moving the patient in order to prevent further damage on the spinal cord. Medications such as steroids and painkillers can reduce the discomfort. A stable fracture can be treated conservatively with rest and immobilization.

It will not spread from person to person, but once the symptoms bring about discomfort, consulting an oculist is necessary.",
  "medicalCondition": "The cause of an allergy is the body's immune system reacting to an allergen that is normally harmless. When an allergen comes into contact with your eye, mast cells within the eye release histamine and other substances to fight against the allergen. This reaction causes your eyes to become red, swollen, itchy and watery. It’s the usually see-through conjunctiva that lies on the white sclera of the eyes that reacts and becomes red.",
  "treatment": "The most important factor in allergic conjunctivitis is to avoid or limit contact with the substance causing the problem. But first you need to determine what to avoid. If necessary, an allergist or dermatologist can perform a skin or blood test to help identify the specific allergen. Medications such as 1) artificial tears, 2) decongestants, 3) antihistamine and 4) corticosteroids are often used to treat the symptoms. ",

Physical traumas are additionally differentiated based on their severeness. If it is a single, minor injury it is called lesion or simple trauma, if it is a life-threatening single injury (e.g. after use of force on the abdomen) it is called barytrauma. A traffic accident or a fall usually causes multiple injuries out of which at least one, sometimes more of them are life-threatening. This is then called polytrauma (major trauma).",

Patients with physical traumas suffer from pain or loss of function (e.g. they can't move their leg after a fracture).

Mental traumas can cause various symptoms as well, from total apathy to shock and hyperactivity.",
  "treatment": "Consequences and treatment depend on the type of injury. Talk therapy or short- or long-term medication help in the event of mental traumas. Sometimes an in-patient therapy in a specialized clinic might be necessary. A complication of a mental trauma is the post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment for physical traumas also depends on the injury. Simple fractures or wounds can be stitched or rested in a plaster cast, while complicated or shifted fractures as well as contaminated, large wounds may require surgery. The more severe the injury or the more injuries a patient has, the more comprehensive is the treatment. Polytraumatized patients often need intensive care with ventilation or multiple surgeries.",

Extended periods of high glucose in the blood cause chemical changes in the nerves throughout the body. High blood sugar may eventually damage the vessels that supply the body’s nerves with nutrition and oxygen, which ultimately leads to gastroparesis as a result of autonomic nervous system failure.

  "treatment": "Treatment of diabetic gastroparesis should begin with controlling of diet and blood sugar levels. A specialist will often suggest that a patient should avoid high-fat and high-fiber food that is not easily digested, and simultaneously check and control blood sugar levels regularly. Prokinetic medication may also assist the stomach to function properly again, however they often have a short term effect. Further treatment in severe cases consists of gastric electrical stimulation. It may reduce nausea and vomiting.

  "description": "The nociceptor is a nerve ending, which will send a signal to the brain when faced with certain stimuli. This may result in a physical feeling of pain, which is also known as nociception. Pain is a perception that signals to people that a physical damage or mental trauma has occurred or may be occurring. However, pain is subjective and very complex. Even though nociceptors all over the body are signalizing pain, the actual sensation of pain is solely located in the brain.",
  "descriptionShort": "Pain is an unpleasant feeling that can be triggered by physical damage or mental traumas. It can be classified as either acute or chronic pain. A doctor will help to determine the cause and then prescribe a proper treatment after diagnosis.",
  "medicalCondition": "Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain lasts a short period of time and is expected to be over soon. Chronic pain lasts much longer. It may last even after recovery of an injury or damage, and continue for several months or longer. However, pain can be categorized into three different types: 1) nociceptive pain, 2) neurogenic pain, and 3) psychogenic pain. Nociceptive pain occurs when there is damage to tissue in the body registered by nociceptors, and neurogenic pain occurs when there is damage to the nervous system. Neurogenic pain is usually not felt at the location of damage but instead in the area of innervations of the damaged nerves. In addition, not only can physical damage cause pain, but mental traumas are also implicated in certain instances of pain. Psychogenic pain is the pain caused by mental and emotional problems. Pain may have characteristics such as being sharp, burning or dull. It may come and go, or it may be on a constant level. Pain can be present in any area of the human body. Pain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. Without pain, people might get hurt without knowing, or might not realize some medical issues.",
  "treatment": "The treatment of pain will mainly depend on the cause, and may include: 1) several oral or intravenous medications, 2) local injection treatments, 3) physical and occupational therapy, 4) Electrical stimulation, 5) alternative medicine, 6) psychological support and 7) surgery. Once the underlying problems are found and treated, the related pain usually quickly diminishes or becomes treatable. More problematic is the therapy of chronic pain with no detectable morphological substrate.",

Besides, there are some diseases that may develop due to pregnancy, for example, 1) gestational diabetes, 2) rhesus incompatibility and 3) eclampsia. A good prenatal care can help detect and treat the problems. Some pregnancy related symptoms like nausea, back pain, breast discomfort, edema in the leg and fatigue are also common during pregnancy. These symptoms are mostly due to normal changes during pregnancy.",
  "treatment": "It is very important for women to receive health care before and during pregnancy to decrease the risk of pregnancy complications. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish whether a symptom is normal during pregnancy or may be a hint for a complication.

  "treatment": "The treatment of a sexually transmitted disease depends on the specific infection. If the disease is caused by bacteria or parasite, medications such as antibiotic or anti-parasitic drugs will be used. If the disease is caused by viruses, then medications can mainly control the symptoms and try to prevent further damage by lowering the virus count. However, a regular follow-up is necessary for people who had a sexually transmitted disease to avoid recurrence.

  "descriptionShort": "Stress is the body’s reaction to extraordinary situations that may cause change, threat, or fear. Stress results in both physical and mental symptoms. If the symptoms of stress start to affect daily life, it is recommended to consult a psychiatrist or a psychologist.",
  "medicalCondition": "Stress is a common condition that most people experience at some point in their lives. But there are two types of stress with different meanings: 1) Eustress describes the positive stress, which encourages people to achieve more than usual. It may lead to a feeling of satisfaction. 2) Distress describes the negative stress that is felt to be threatening or overstraining. This sort of stress can be produced by seriously dangerous situations like an accident, war or a natural disaster. But also less disastrous situations, like problems in the job or family, can lead to distress, when there is no compensation for stress or when a person feels helpless and does not know a way to handle with it. When a stress response is triggered, a series of changes will occur within the human body. For example: 1) a rise in pulse rate, 2) redirection of blood away from the extremities and to the major organs, and 3) release of cortisone, adrenalin and noradrenalin, which may cause physical and mental short and long term changes. However, the symptoms caused by stress will differ from person to person. Some people will feel physical symptoms such as headache, pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea or dizziness. And some may have mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and loss of sexual drive. Chronic distress may lead to a so called burnout-syndrome.",

Therefore it is recommended to avoid exposure to excessive noise. If symptoms such as earache, tinnitus and loss of hearing occur, seeing an otolaryngologist is necessary.",
  "medicalCondition": "The ear consists of three main parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. The outer ear is built by the auricle and the ear canal. The eardrum separates the outer from the middle ear. Small bones in the middle ear help transfer sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. Here, the vibrations become nerve impulses with the aid of sensory cells. These sensory cells can be damaged by overexposure to noise. Both, acute noise trauma and prolonged exposure to loud noise damage and destroy the sensory cells. As the number of sensory cells decreases, so does the hearing function. There is no way to restore the sensory cells, so the damage is permanent. The louder the noise and the longer someone is exposed to it, the more damage will be caused. The common symptoms of excessive noise exposure include: 1) hearing loss, 2) tinnitus, 3) anxiety and irritability, 4) pulse and blood pressure increase, 5) earache.",
  "treatment": "To avoid excessive noise exposure, one should avoid staying in a noisy environment.

Before voice overuse can be treated, it is important to know the reasons why the voice overuse happened. When symptoms occur, seeing a general practitioner or an otolaryngologist is necessary.",
  "medicalCondition": "Many people use their voice for work. For example, singers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, nurses, sales persons, and public speakers are among those who make great demands on their voices. This puts them at risk for developing voice problems. Besides, there are also some common situations that are associated with voice overuse such as: 1) speaking in noisy environment, 2) using cell phone or telephone excessively, 3) speaking with a pitch that is not appropriate, and 4) not using amplification when speaking in public. Our voice is produced by vibration of the vocal folds, which are two bands of smooth muscle tissue in the larynx. The larynx is located between the base of the tongue and the top of the trachea, which is the passageway to the lungs. Once we use an inappropriate way to speak for too long, it might increase vocal effort and lead to vocal fatigue, hoarseness, vocal cord lesions or hemorrhage and even laryngeal inflammation (laryngitis). If the vocal folds are overstrained for a long time (chronic), vocal fold nodules may occur and leading to permanent hoarseness, foreign body sensation and excessive hawking.",

Some of the bacteria living in plaque are able to destroy enamel. These bacteria get promoted by the presence of sugar. Once the enamel is damaged, holes begin to form on the surface of the tooth and the bacteria spread deeper into the tooth.

  "descriptionShort": "The condition of cardiomyopathy combines a number of heart-muscle conditions that lead to a decreasing functioning of the heart, therefore developing a cardiomyopathy.",
  "medicalCondition": "There are 5 main types of cardiomyopathy. A dilative cardiomyopathy (“sacculation“ and enlargement of the heart, so that lesser amounts of blood are being pumped into the body circulation) occurs due to genetic factors, as part of circulatory disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease) and heart attack, following virus infections. Patients suffer from breathlessness, cardiac arrhythmia and general symptoms such as weakness and fatigue. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leads to a thickening musculature mainly of the left heart, without gaining any strength. On the contrary, muscle strength rather decreases! The result is a decrease in the amount of blood being pumped into the body circulation, due to the reduced muscle strength (non-obstructive type) or due to movements/tightening of the blood’s path (obstructive type). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also shows symptoms such as breathlessness under strain, cardiac arrhythmia and the general symptoms mentioned above. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very stiff. It can’t be filled with the sufficient amount of blood anymore, and the blood accumulates in front of the heart. This also leads to breathlessness, but also to an enlarged liver and spleen and may cause dysfunctions. Patients also suffer from swollen and heavy legs. The fourth type is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. When suffering from this type, heart muscle tissue is being more and more replaced by fatty and connective tissue. This tissue is less durable and tends to sag out, similar to the dilative cardiomyopathy. Fatty and connective tissue also doesn’t have the functions of muscle tissue and can’t contract to pump blood into the circulation. Patients suffer from short periods of unconsciousness, irregular heartbeat and heart palpitations. The fifth type is non-classifiable cardiomyopathies. All types can lead to sudden cardiac death.",
  "treatment": "Some examinations are required to identify the type of cardiomyopathy. The symptoms provide a first idea. One of the first measures is usually an ECG and the analysis thereof, followed by chest x-rays as well as a heart ultrasound. The blood parameters will be determined, and a catheter examination of the heart or a sample taking may be considered as well. Therapy and prognosis depend on the identified type of cardiomyopathy. All measures include omission of substances or habits that can damage the heart (alcohol, smoking, certain medication), as well as rest. Cardiac insufficiency will be treated as well, but with different approaches. Additional specific measures are necessary for the respective types. This may include therapy of the underlying cause, pacemaker implantation, surgeries or even a heart transplant. The doctor will discuss the individual therapy with the patient. All cardiomyopathies are serious conditions that can strongly impair the patients’ daily activities and require intensive therapy, depending on the stage of severity. Despite all options, sudden cardiac death or other life-threatening complications occur frequently.",

  "descriptionShort": "A lymphedema is a stowage of tissue fluid inside the subcutaneous fat tissue. Due to various causes the lymphatic vessels’ transport capacity can be exceeded, so that fluid remains inside the tissue.",
  "medicalCondition": "The manifestation of a lymphedema can be separated into 4 stages (0-3). Stage 0 shows an impaired transport capacity of the lymphatic vessels, but no swelling is visible. A so-called soft swelling, that can be pressed with the thumb and disappears very slowly, only develops during stage 1. Stages 0 and 1 can be cured completely with the adequate therapy. In stage 2, the constantly high pressure of the tissues leads to changes on and inside the skin (fibrosis). Unlike stage 1, stage 2 shows a hard swelling, it is difficult to press a dent into the oedema. Despite intensive therapy, the symptoms of this stage are only partly curable. Massive swellings develop in stage 3, which are called elephantiasis. The skin is rough and thickened. This stage is irreversible. Patients mainly complain about feelings of heaviness and tension of the affected body parts. If the oedema is located near the joints, limited mobility will be an additional symptom.",
  "treatment": "New lymphedema need to be examined to find out, if it is an actual lymphedema, or a swelling caused by a weakness of the venous system. The experienced doctor can do this with a diligent anamnesis interview and a physical examination. It is important to determine the causes of the lymphedema, because it will define the therapy. The main therapy includes manual lymphatic drainage, skincare, compression therapy with wraps or stockings, as well as decongestant movement therapy. The affected region of the body (e.g. a leg) should also be elevated. In some situations, surgery might be necessary.",

  "description": "Shingles is most common in older adults and people who have a weak immune system due to certain medicine, an injury, stress, or other conditions. Most people who get shingles do recover and will not get it again. However, it is possible to get shingles more than once.",
  "descriptionShort": "Herpes zoster, also named shingles or zona, is a highly contagious infection, which is caused by a varicella-zoster virus infection and usually affects adults. Most individuals get infected by the virus during their childhood with the virus causing then chickenpox.",
  "medicalCondition": "We are talking about shingles, when the virus which causes chickenpox is activated again in the body. After a child gets better from chickenpox, the virus is dormant or sleeps in the roots of the nerves. This virus can sleep forever in some people but it can wake up in other people due to aging, stress, or another disease that weakens the immune system. In addition, some medicine can trigger the virus to be active again and this can cause a shingles rash. The mechanism is not clear but once triggered, the virus causes only shingles, not chickenpox. Symptoms of shingles occur in phases. Sensitivity to light or headache, flu without fever are common at the beginning. Later, the patient may feel pain, tingling, or itching in some areas and a few days later, a small spot of rash will appear there. The rash will turn into clusters of blisters filled with fluid before they crust over. The blisters heal generally within two to four weeks and they may leave scars. The symptoms vary as some people get just a mild rash while others do not get a rash at all. As the disease gets worse, the patient may feel weak or dizzy, or have changes in their vision with rash covering the whole face or many parts of the body. The patient can have also some changes in their ability to think.",
  "treatment": "There are medicines to treat shingles and these medicines include pain and antiviral medicines. An early treatment with antiviral medicine can help that the rash heals quickly and is less painful. The affected person can also made feel better quickly with a good home care. The skin sores should be kept clean and it is recommended to call a doctor if the pain bothers the affected perons. If suited the doctor can prescribe pain medicine.",

The disease can be diagnosed by a lab test and should be treated immediately to avoid further complications.

  "medicalCondition": "The cause of the infection are bacteria, which are called chlamydia trachomatis. The bacteria are passed onto someone else through contact with the genitals or the rectum during sexual intercourse. They lead to infections in the urogenital tract or rectal area. In men they can cause urethritis, epididymitis, proctitis and prostatitis. In woman they can cause urethritis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). If a woman has PID, it may lead to infertility or problems during pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is infected with chlamydia, the baby may get a bacterial eye infection or pneumonia. Generally speaking, chlamydia infection often does not cause obvious symptoms. These minor symptoms may include lower abdominal pain, pain during urination, yellow-whitish discharge and itchiness of genitals and, rarely, fever and chills.",
  "treatment": "Since the cause of chlamydia infection is bacteria, the treatment is mainly antibiotics. It is strongly recommended to avoid sexual contact during the period of treatment and it is necessary that the partner is treated as well. A regular follow-up is necessary for people who had chlamydia infection to avoid the recurrence, especially women who wish to fall pregnant.",
